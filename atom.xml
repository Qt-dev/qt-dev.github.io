    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>I&rsquo;m back</h2>

<p>Hey everybody, I am back!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for not giving news, the end of DBC program was &hellip; strange. You spend 9 weeks averaging on 85 hours a week in Dev Bootcamp, coding, and when it stops and the building is closed (we moved that same weekend), your life feels&hellip; empty.</p>

<p>So on the next day, for the weekend, I slept, ate, and slept again. Then I coded a bit, refactored some old things, cleaned readmes and tests, and that was it. I think I can safely say  that it was at least in the top 5 of my most unproductive weekends ever. But then, maybe it&rsquo;s just the contrast with the 9 others before that&hellip;</p>

<p>After that, on that tuesday evening, Thuy arrived, with her sister and her sister&rsquo;s boyfriend. I could spend hours, or even days describing the next week, but let me try to sum it up :</p>

<p>We walked all around San Francisco, did a lot of touristy things in the city, biked on the golden gate bridge, went to <a href="http://oaklandartmurmur.org/">Oakland Murmur</a>, and a thousand times to the piers. All in all, it was a hard week (13 miles walks everyday&hellip;) but a very fun and interesting one. I discovered the city and feel much better about it now, I spent all of my time with my wonderful fiancee, I showed her everything she wanted to see, and some things that I wanted to show her, showed her DBC and the people&hellip; Perfect!</p>

<p>Plus, I now have a crazy tan, like I spent the week in Hawaii haha.</p>

<h2>Job Hunting</h2>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m back to job hunting. Once you get out, your next target is a corresponding job!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a company that would allow me to learn and show the world what I can do, like I keep on saying in that blog. Discovering is my thing, and writing meaningful code is its little brother!</p>

<p>My plan right now is to join as many meetups as I can to be able to show what I can do, to work on interesting personal projects that can help in that goal too, and try and contact the people I can find who can help me with that.</p>

<p>I would rather stay in SF, or in the US, but I moved, and I&rsquo;ll move if need be!</p>

<p>In case you are interested or know somebody who could be, here is</p>

<ul>
<li>my linked in :
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/quentindevauchelle">http://www.linkedin.com/in/quentindevauchelle</a></li>
<li>my github :
<a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev">https://github.com/Qt-dev</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Back to work</h2>

<p>I now HAVE to code, it&rsquo;s in my blood! ;)</p>

<p>So, I took that need for proof of my skills for a good enough excuse to go back on the projects I had not had time for before.</p>

<p>So I started working on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Js version of my android app : <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev/craftmeapass-web">Github</a>,</li>
<li>I refactored and cleaned our gem : <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev/cool-faker">Github</a> / <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/cool_faker">Rubygems</a>,</li>
<li>I started working on a scheduler for Thuy and her airport schedule : <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev/scheduler">Github</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you have ideas about projects I could join, just send a mail to quentin@devauchelle.eu, I&rsquo;ll be happy to work on them!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, yesterday, I graduated. I now have my very own dog tags with my name on it. I am &ldquo;officially&rdquo; a web developer. I will try to not spoil it too much for the people still in the program, but I do have to talk about this day.</p>

<p>If I had to sum that day up in one word, I&#8217;ld say : &lsquo;Tears&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The day started with the usual friday group checkins. What came out of that were that other cohorts were excited for everything new (every cohort is getting to the next phase on monday, DBC is moving, a new cohort is coming too&hellip;), and unhappy about us moving out. But then, like we told them again and again, we are not going anywhere.</p>

<p>After that, we presented our projects. A lot of clapping, a lot of laughing, and being impressed by every one of them. Also, for some reason, Rao discovered that I existed that very day, apparently. He asked me what was that necklace that I am wearing&hellip; But then I have been wearing that every single day for 3 years now&hellip; But that&rsquo;s fine, I still love him !</p>

<p>Then, we came back to coding&hellip; psych, we did not write a single line that day. We ate these things DBC had ordered for us (COOKIES!), and then I took a huge nap.</p>

<p>I got waken up when Steven, one of our teachers, was about to speak about a nice life lesson he got some time ago. I won&rsquo;t tell you the whole story but I will just sum it up with :<br/>
The day you start resenting everything about where you are, what you do, what you life looks like&hellip; Take a step back. Cash in on some money you have, and get out. Physically, mentally, it does not matter, just get out. I think this is a great advice that sometimes people just don&rsquo;t follow. I got stuck in France and ended up needing friends and family to pull me out because I had not plan any kind of exit strategy&hellip; Don&rsquo;t be me!</p>

<p>After that, we went to the park, and without telling you much about it, let&rsquo;s just say we had the chance to say what we thought about people. And I just wanted to say, from the bottom of my heart, that I hate you, banana slugs, so much for the amount of tears you made me cry! ;)</p>

<p>Let me give you a quick example of things I heard :</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Quentin, if I explained how much I like you in a sentence right now&hellip; That would mean I have not spent the 9 last weeks with you and did not know you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thanks to you, becoming a better person seems so easy&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I love your scarf&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>There were plenty of others, these are just the 3 ones that came to my mind right now, you probably get the tone anyway.</p>

<p>After that, we went back, and graduated. We were welcomed with that High-Five tunnel that greeted us the very first day, then they gave us our dog tags,&hellip; and we partied until 2 in the morning!</p>

<p>I spent almost all of my night trying to tell people how much I love them and how grateful I am that I met them. These 9 weeks were such an adventure&hellip;</p>

<h2>The end&hellip; ?</h2>

<p>Now, I am out, but what I feel is that the training ended, now it&rsquo;s time for the big game. I am never leaving these people, I will haunt them forever, at least just to thank them for how good they made me feel.</p>

<p>And if I end up making them happy one day in their lives, I will consider myself happy. And to all the DBC Staff, all the alumnus, all the current students, my cohort and the others, I am talking about all of you. You are SO going to regret making me feel that good ;)</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/28/week-9-day-4-presentation/"/>

    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/28/week-9-day-4-presentation</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>Tomorrow is the big day. I am writing this in advance to make sure I have time to do it before tomorrow ends, because I know that it is going to be crazy.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is my last day as a boot in Dev Bootcamp. After our usual friday group check-ins, our team will present our final project, then talk about the next week and job searching, and spend the rest of the day pretty much partying&hellip;</p>

<p>So, today, to prepare, we worked on the presentation. I was hesitating, wondering if I could speak about refactoring (I did a bit of that&hellip; I had a 5 hours streak on it, with 28 commits in the pull request at the end&hellip;), but I don&rsquo;t think it is as interesting as the other things to talk about. At some points, we have to make choices, right?</p>

<p>I will be talking about the javascript part of that app. Basically, since I worked a lot on the connection between pages in javascript, I will be explaining how I built the whole engine. Also, I will try to push the fact that everything is done with very simple methods, clear and readable (still available on <a href="https://github.com/banana-slugs-2014/GlucoseAmigo">github</a>).</p>

<p>When you work with a team on a very tight schedule (= all the time) you have to have concise code. You will never go back and edit/refactor the part you did not have time to write correctly today, and if you think otherwise, you are wrong!</p>

<h2>Giving thanks</h2>

<p>I always had the feeling that people don&rsquo;t get the praises they deserve.</p>

<p>Everywhere you go, no matter what you do, people will see the bad sides. If they see the good parts, then they will just not give it enough importance to praise as much as they would complain if they were bad&hellip;</p>

<p>When I got accepted for DBC, I thought I needed to work on it, in my own tiny world. After all, one of the idioms I try and follow is &ldquo;Be the change you want to see in the world&rdquo; &ndash; Gandhi.</p>

<p>So, back in France, I ended up finding old teacher that taught me how to do some things that people called useless, just to tell them how useful they were to me. I went to talk to everybody about what they were doing good&hellip;</p>

<p>I like to think that if I am in a very good place, I have the power to have a word that matters to most. If I don&rsquo;t use it, I am doing something wrong.</p>

<p>So today, I went to Steven, one of our teachers, to tell him about how inspiring he is to me. My words were, more or less : &ldquo;Before I came here, I ended up doubting myself, thinking that I was taking the wrong path, that I should not be all that &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; and start getting into the norm. But coming here, I realized a lot of people are like me. And I feel like he tends to be crazy a bit like I could be, and thanks to that, no matter where I go after that, I will forever know that there are people just like me, in a place somewhere, that they are doing great, and inspiring billions of people. So thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then ended up speaking with Shereef, the creator of Dev Bootcamp, and having more or less the same words. Also, I had a meeting with Sefora, a DBC staff member that works for the mental well being of the boots, and was very grateful that I met her. I am looking forward to having more conversations with all of these awesome people&hellip; I have so much to learn!</p>

<h2>D-4</h2>

<p>Today was the day we talk and meet people. In that same idea, I found out that I may end up introducing Thuy to new people everyday of her stay in here.</p>

<p>Teachers and DBC staff are on the list, alumni too, and then even current boots!</p>

<p>I know that there are some nice places and events that happen usually the first week of the month in SF apparently (I just discovered that), and so I will probably end up in all these things, with all these people.</p>

<p>I can say without much doubt that it will be an awesome week and I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>

    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/26/week-9-day-3-personnalities</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Glucose Amigos</h2>

<p>What an awesome name, that our captain found us! And here is the site : <a href="http://glucose-amigo.herokuapp.com">Glucose Amigo</a></p>

<p>So, we pretty much finished the app. This, guys, is what we can do in one week, with 4-5 of us, after 9 weeks of hard work. We came all with different experiences, behaviors, point of views, and in the end&hellip; We build a full app in one week.</p>

<p>I wish I would have more time to spend on the testing (I did most of the Javascript, there are 2 test, one on the login one on the logout&hellip;), but after that week of working with that awesome team, what I want to say is : Thank you DBC, thank you team, and thank you captain!</p>

<p>Working with all these awesome people is incredible!</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the app (and not read the &ldquo;help&rdquo; in the menu), the idea is that we made an app that keeps track of one or multiple diabetics&rsquo;s blood sugar level and weight, gives you a graph and a list of records, sends it per mail to your doctor, and can remind you to measure, and log the measures.</p>

<h2>Personalities</h2>

<p>In these 9 weeks, I saw a lot of different personalities. For example, among the people I paired with, I found 2 different types of people:</p>

<ul>
<li>People who want everything to be done, at the cost of understanding everything, but will not hesitate in going back at it to learn more about what they did not understood the first time</li>
<li>People who take the time to discover and learn everything even if it ends up taking them more than twice the time everybody else takes.</li>
</ul>


<p>I paired with both, and &hellip; strangely enough, no conflict emerged from it! I think I am a bit more of the second, but in the days I was working with somebody from the other group, I would just work his/her way, or use my &ldquo;reputation&rdquo; to try and teach the other person, go over what I did not see fully before, and go deeper.</p>

<p>In the end, I think I got most of what I could get from DBC, and mostly, I got the one lesson everybody should take : You don&rsquo;t know anything. Thinking you do is dangerous, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>Some people may think that this is just a fancy way to say that when you actually know what you&rsquo;re talking about (For real, I have already been told), but honestly, it is 100% of the truth. The difference between a confident person and and a stressed out one is quite often the fact that the confident already knows he has no idea what he&rsquo;s doing, but knows how to figure things out, learn, and maybe next time not have to spend too much time on it.</p>

<p>Also, we had to work on a personality test for our career week at DBC. My results&hellip; : <a href="http://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">You are an ENTJ</a>.</p>

<p>If I have to sum it up, I would say I am a confident and convincing leader who need people to survive and who sometimes end up relying too much on emotions. I don&rsquo;t know if it is true, but I like the description, so that&rsquo;s a start!</p>

<h2>D-5</h2>

<p>So, 5 days huh&hellip;</p>

<p>I learn a lot of new things around, about SF, about the city and everything around it, just to make sure I can be the perfect guide for Thuy. I have found cookies places that will blow her mind, and I think I found some great example of SF food that would make her love the place.</p>

<p>In the time I&rsquo;ve been here, I have not had any time to discover anything, but even in that small 10 blocks area that I lived in, I still found restaurants that have nothing to do with what we have in Paris, kinds of food we never ate, and better versions of things we found elsewhere (Of course, I did not find better bread, but that is another topic&hellip;)</p>

<p>I could say I have not seen the sea, Alcatraz, the bridges, or many other things, but the thing that I feel like I want to discover the most is &hellip; SF food and drinks! Maybe that is her influence, who knows&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, in the end, I just want to say thank you to SF in a whole. Your food rocks so hard I became addicted and I can&rsquo;t wait to get her hooked on that too ;)</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/26/week-9-day-1/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-26T14:25:17-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/26/week-9-day-1</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First of all, I&rsquo;ll start by saying I am sorry I did not write before. I have been&hellip;overwhelmed by a few things I will try to sum up in this article, and just ended up having no time anyway.</p>

<h2>Ajax Everything</h2>

<p>So, our app is going great! You can see its evolution on : <a href="https://github.com/banana-slugs-2014/GlucoseAmigo">Github</a>. In all that, one of the biggest thing I played with on this app is the javascript. If you look in /app/assets/javascripts, you&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

<p>The idea is that we ended up developing everything separately (doctors, diabetics, records, etc&hellip;) and I ended up in charge of connecting it altogether in Javascript. To do so, I play with two types of routes in the app :</p>

<p>1 &ndash; Routes that render JSON :
Basically, I render a JSON object with 3 parameters :</p>

<ul>
<li>ok :  true or false, tells the javascript if the operation succeeded or not</li>
<li>path : The address of the next page</li>
<li>alert : The eventual problems or info messages.</li>
</ul>


<p>2 &ndash; Routes that render partials :
These render a small baby-html page with some javascript code to populate the javascript templates when it loads.</p>

<p>The idea is that every action and button is plugged on an action on the controller that calls a route that render JSON. If it returns ok:true, then I take the path, ask for the partial from it in javascript, and render it in the middle of the page, populating javascript templates on the go. If not, I print the alerts for 5 seconds and don&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>I had fun doing that and even though it needs a lot of refactoring right now, I hope you can see that and enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it.</p>

<h2>Pressure</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you get stuck in a strange loop. I just &hellip; had that exact thing.</p>

<p>I put a lot of pressure on me, to make sure I can make my way out of the life I had in France. Because of that, I end up sleeping less. But then if I sleep less, I think about that more, and sleep even less&hellip; * infinite loop *.</p>

<p>At some point, it breaks, and so it did. I ended up completely exhausted last thursday/friday, with a lot of things on my mind. I have to impress people to make sure I can move. But then I also know that I fought my way through to Dev Bootcamp, I worked hard IN Dev Bootcamp, I WILL make it happen no matter what. But it was not that clear at that time.</p>

<p>I gave this analogy to the people who ended up listening :<br/>
Picture a black NBA player that comes from a bad neighborhood.
He struggled to get food when he was a kid. He struggled against racism his whole life. He fought the system in school, every step of the way.<br/>
Now, he is fighting to get in the playoff and to be the MVP of every match he plays.</p>

<p>Well, if today, you were to tell him to go back to struggling to get food, he would be disappointed, probably angry, but he made it once and you can be sure he&rsquo;ll make it twice.</p>

<p>This is the kind of idea I have about going back to France. I don&rsquo;t mind struggling to find a better job, to make the world a better place, to make the difference against much more intelligent people. But what I would not like would be to have to go back to struggling for minimum wages with a 2 hours commute every morning every evening, and only 6 hours of seeing my fiance every week. I fought my way through, and I would rather not get back to that.<br/>
But then if I have to&hellip; I will.</p>

<p>The only thing I know now, is that I am a new person, and you can be sure that I will fight as much as I can to get my fiance, my sister, and the people I loved to the comfortable places that they deserve, and the world a better place, one step at a time.</p>

<h2>D-6</h2>

<p>She&rsquo;s coming!!!</p>

<p><strong>She&rsquo;s coming!!!</strong></p>

<p>My fiance, Thuy, the wonderful woman that actually chose to stick with me for 6 years now (I know, people are crazy&hellip;) is coming to San Francisco! I finally have the chance to get her into that world, show her what&rsquo;s happening, introduce her to the wonderful people I met&hellip;</p>

<p>And make her taste the great foods I found!</p>

<p>She still thinks that in the 7 days she get in here, she will end up getting a burger at burger king&hellip; Come on, people from here, let&rsquo;s laugh about it together ;)</p>

<p>She will be coming on next tuesday and I don&rsquo;t know how much I will be blogging at that point, but right now&hellip; It&rsquo;s D-6!</p>

<h2>An end before a new beginning</h2>

<p>Dev Bootcamp is coming to an end!</p>

<p>We are on our way to finish our last projects, we had fun, learned a lot, and met really cool people (looking at you, Chris! Haha). But this is now coming to an end.</p>

<p>However, I don&rsquo;t take it as an end but more like a beginning. I am a new self. I am a new this (got this, fellow developers?). I am a new person that now has the rest of his life to profit from this extraordinary experience.</p>

<p>I see that as the beginning of a new life that I will start, happily, with my fiance, or wife, we&rsquo;ll not stay like that for too long I hope. Not completely unlinked from the old life, but as a continuity, I see the before-graduation period as a preparatory stage for what is coming.</p>

<p>Now, things are different, it is a new life, and I intend to be very good at it!</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/21/week-8-day-4-group-project/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-21T12:46:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/21/week-8-day-4-group-project</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Group Project</h2>

<p>The big even of yesterday was: The final projects pitching.</p>

<p>Almost everybody pitched. You had good projects, strange projects, fun projects, good things!</p>

<p>The one I pitched was about Role Playing Games. The idea is that I really enjoy pen and paper role playing games, but I also can&rsquo;t play them most of the time. My friends are all around the world, and I don&rsquo;t spend my time with my character sheets, dice, and/or books in my pocket.</p>

<p>So to counter that, I wanted to make an app that makes the link between players and game masters, and give you these commands that will give you all the infos you have in these books, all the character sheets, and the dice rolling, just by sending a mail with different commands.</p>

<p>In the end, I was not picked as one of the projects we would work on, but then among the 5 projects, 3 were projects that I really want to work on!</p>

<p>So in the end, I am in Armando&rsquo;s team, and we are about to make a great app for diabetics to track their blood sugar stats and format them decently to transmit them to a doctor. I find it awesome and in a way, I am glad I was not picked!</p>

<h2>More pressure</h2>

<p>I put a lot of pressure on myself. Most of the time, I will not seem very stressed out, but inside, I may just be completely freaking out.</p>

<p>The idea is that I overthink everything. Being logical enough, I overthink without putting too much emotions and feeling in these thoughts. I see something, try to find all the outcomes (I will never succeed, but well&hellip;), try to think about the causes and consequences, study everybody&rsquo;s point of view&hellip;</p>

<p>In the end, I like to think that it makes me calm and not stress out much on the outside.</p>

<p>Lately, the fact that I am coming to a situation that had a bad outcome the last time(the same situation I came to when I came back from korea), made me think about a lot of things, basically ways to prevent myself from falling in the same trap again. That just made me sleep less&hellip; which actually made me think more&hellip; And I fell into this strange loop that ended with me being exhausted, and giving too much credit to emotions and feelings.</p>

<h2>Sleep depravation</h2>

<p>The lack of sleep I am talking about is mainly due to a non restful sleep. A sleep where you keep on waking up, thinking about bad things, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>This lack of sleep makes you take bad paths, the wrong paths, basically. In the end, I am now sleep depraved, and even though I worked on that pressure, and talking about it was enough to relieve a lot of pain on that topic, sleeping 6h does not make you really rested, especially if you&rsquo;ve been running on 5s for weeks&hellip;</p>

<p>But then, I am a logical person. I am also a person who does fall deep into these pressure cycles, but overcomes that. I did that before, a lot of time, and approaching things logically just ends up making me overcome whatever emotional challenge I have had so far.</p>

<p>So I work on my sleep, on my well being, and I am now much better than yesterday. Soon, I will be even better, and be sure that at the same time next week, our team will be kicking asses, and I will not be dragging them down!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Clean Javascript</h2>

<p>I will never say that enough, but if you code in Javascript and don&rsquo;t make it object oriented, you&rsquo;re missing something.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I paired with Johnny on a full frontend page. The idea is that we had a rails server with built-in routes, and we had to make the whole Javascript app that did everything with these routes, all in one page</p>

<p>In the end, we built a huge machine, all in Javascript, pure javascript (We did use some JQuery here and there, but the rest was all in javascript). That was fun, we played a lot, and we still finished what was expected of us for the whole day at 3PM.</p>

<p>In the end, we both learned a lot, had a lot of fun, and made a huge thing.</p>

<p>And the Javascript was&hellip; CLEAN! Object oriented, module pattern, fun stuff! No soup, no 100+ lines scripts&hellip;</p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>

<p>Tomorrow is the pitching day. I can feel the pressure, even though I do love it.</p>

<p>The idea is that we pitch an idea to the whole bootcamp. Then, people from our cohort vote for projects, and the teachers select 4 or 5 and we have to work on that until the very day.<br/>
The person who pitched the project will lead his/her 4-5 people group through that.</p>

<p>I am expecting a lot from that. I always loved to lead group (If you asked me when I was a kid I would have said that when I grow up, I want to be &hellip; a boss. The guy who make it so that things actually work, and that the whole team make it happen). Now, tomorrow is my chance to do that WITH code.</p>

<p>Plus, I have that strange feeling that tells me I don&rsquo;t have to show people some code, I have to IMPRESS people. Working on that group project, on one of my ideas, leading a group the right way, and coding my way through that, I think I can make that happen.</p>

<p>I will tell you more about it when that is over but&hellip; I feel like things are going to get crazy pretty fast&hellip; I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>

<h2>Leadership</h2>

<p>Leadership is something I like. It is something I always liked. Apparently, lastly, people like my leadership too, which gives me more opportunity to train that!</p>

<p>In the end, I always worked on that, always loved that, and not because I am a power hungry bearded dude, but because I want things to go well. When I am in a team, I love to be able to guide any part of the project in the right direction, to ensure a great realization. But then, there are things you can&rsquo;t change. Most of the time, you can&rsquo;t change the leader for instance. And if things are not working correctly, I would say it is his/her responsibility! So to fight that, I always wanted to lead, and be able to change whatever needed to be changed, even myself.</p>

<p>Today, I had a fun conversation with David of Phase 1 and Stephen. The topic was : Games and Leadership.</p>

<p>I loved to have feedback on the feeling I give to people around, to hear about the ideas David and Stephen had, and to share everybody&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>These people are just &hellip; AWESOME!</p>

<p>I will tell you more about it whenever I can but for now&hellip; It&rsquo;s time to sleep for a good pitching day!</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/19/week-8-day-2-jquery/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-19T09:04:15-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/19/week-8-day-2-jquery</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>JQuery</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I paired with Ivan. I like the fact that even if he had not been fully recommended for phase 2, he kicks ass in phase 3!</p>

<p>We build a new version of JQuery, just to make sure we understood things, we got in the mind of libraries makers, and we broke the idea of &ldquo;this is magic&rdquo; that everybody has. The idea is to not be a consumer of music, but more of an audiophile, or even a sound engineer if that is what we are looking for (Said by <a href="https://twitter.com/sgharms">Steven</a>).</p>

<p>And so we worked on that, made the whole part of the library we had to, with clean and tricky javascript.</p>

<p>In the end, I had a very good coding day. At 6, we had finished the program, understood what we had to take from it, and had a clean refactored code. All in all, I can say we rocked ;)</p>

<h2>Superego</h2>

<p>Yesterday was also the new day where phase 1 learn about their superego. Just like every time a phase get in one, we get to witness that change in some mentalities, that feeling that make people talk more, share more of their experiences, knowing that things happened the same way for all of us.</p>

<p>In the end, some, mostly outspoken people, reacted with the experience being easy on them. When you don&rsquo;t hesitate in sharing and talking, sharing about your superego should not affect you that much, right?</p>

<p>Some others were more affected and ended up sharing more (Go David!).</p>

<p>Most of them though had already one week before that hard session. So in the end, it was &ldquo;less&rdquo; heavy on them.</p>

<p>But since that made people share a bit more, I love it ^.^</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>I have a tremendous amount of cookies in my locker.</p>

<p>Coming here, I started eating a lot of cookies. I went to good bakeries, found ways to get more, etc.. to the point that nowadays, I am called &ldquo;Cookie Monster&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I went and get some at Subway. When it&rsquo;s 10€ for 12 in your country, but 5$ for 12 here&hellip; you don&rsquo;t hesitate much, do you?<br/>
But then I also got some cookies from &ldquo;Batter&rdquo;, a very good bakery down the street apparently.</p>

<p>So in my locker I have close to 30 huge cookies just waiting for me.</p>

<p>Then, a funny thing happened. 2 days ago, I paired with Chris. We finished in a decent amount of time, and while he was &ldquo;expected&rdquo; to get home around 10PM, he actually came home around 7.</p>

<p>So his girlfriend ended up saying:  &ldquo;How come?&#8221;<br/>
And the answer she got was apparently : &#8220;Quentin&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>After that, she just suggested she would bake cookies to thank me&hellip;</p>

<p>So&hellip; I am getting more cookies! Thuy is gonna be so proud ;)</p>

    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/18/week-8-day-1-making-pages-fast</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Making pages fast</h2>

<p>Yesterday, we had a fun day about optimisation. The idea is that we had pages that were loading in 20 seconds or more, and we had to find ways to fasten them.</p>

<p>What we got from that is, among others :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use SQL requests to order, group, etc&hellip;  It is MUCH faster than getting everything from the database and sorting it in ruby or JS</li>
<li>JS allows you to act as if you loaded everything even if you did not, USE THAT. Play with ajax, load only the titles, and when somebody clicks on a button, you load the rest!</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end, all the pages were loading under 200 ms. Next part is destroying these pages to make useful ones instead haha.</p>

<h2>Group projects</h2>

<p>We just finished the weekend group project with Armando, Hunter, Chermaine, and Matthew. It was really a bread group, a great dynamic. We were very laid back, no stress or anything. We did finish what we wanted and even more, everything works, and we had clear, maintainable, and tested code.</p>

<p>Now with that being said, we have the final group projects coming on Thursday. People have been talking about it fo a bit now, sharing ideas that people are gonna pitch, checking them out&hellip;</p>

<p>I know I have a few ideas on my own, and I am interested in pitching them and then leading a group with that. I will not talk about them now, especially since they&rsquo;re not that clear in my mind even now, but don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; It&rsquo;s coming ;)</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I ate with fiery skippers. I find it really amazing that people are so different from the cohorts we could see so far. They are a huge group of very knowledge hungry people.</p>

<p>During the weekend, I also spent a lot of time with them, trying to push them in the right direction to solve Sudoku, the challenge people complete in the first week.</p>

<p>I also spent a bit of time with phase 2 Golden Bears, trying to share what I know.</p>

<p>And yesterday, I spent an hour with Armando showing him a way to complete some Javascript exercise without feeling lost about being in a language he is not used to.
In the end, I just showed him how to solve the problem in Ruby, a language he feels more comfortable in, and how to translate it to Javascript.</p>

<p>I loved teaching in Korea, and before that. I like to share my knowledge (which, if you follow the famous french saying, means that I have very little knowledge myself). And now I see that even here, I love doing that.</p>

<p>I love trying to explain things to people actually listening, and using what you are showing them.</p>

<p>I think that after DBC, I will try to be a coach. I think I can be a decent help, and have a lot of fun doing it!</p>

<p>Anyway, that is for in 2 weeks, which in DBC time means something like 2 or 3 months ^.^</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/14/week-7-day-4-todos/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-14T08:52:10-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/14/week-7-day-4-todos</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Todos</h2>

<p>So, in DBC, we made Todos. When I say that, I mean, we learned how to make a todo app jn Ruby, with the command line. Then we learned how to make a new one that saves and read things in a file. After that we got in phase 2 and made a simple Sinatra Todo app. Then we made one that used Javascript, and now we&rsquo;re 4 days into phase 3, and we already made 2 todo apps.</p>

<p>I feel like there is a common theme somewhere&hellip; Are DBC teachers trying to tell us something?</p>

<p>I do not tend to use todo apps myself nowadays but I now know how to make it however I want. I also know how to manage my time, or&hellip;  know how to not manage my time actually.</p>

<p>As for code, I know that using that same theme to learn new things help a lot, and I feel like I can learn what I want to learn by simply making a todo with it and comparing with what I know.</p>

<p>And since I intend to learn much more&hellip; I end up with many todos apps eon my todo list&hellip;</p>

<h2>Group Project</h2>

<p>We got a small group project again, in Rails. Things are much easier, Rails does everything, people are confident, and we can now play with these interesting things, at our own pace, without stressing out!</p>

<p>This week we have to make a &ldquo;Stack Overflow&rdquo;-like app. Basically, answer questions, select the best answer, and comment questions or answers. Also, they can vote for a question or an answer, and the site makes the selection after that.</p>

<p>I am not even sure what to say about that, but it is what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re having fun, and have an awesome group again, I guess I&rsquo;ll have something to show on monday, but even if I don&rsquo;t&hellip; No biggie!</p>

<h2>Effects of DBC</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I did something that triggered <a href="http://mknudsen01.tumblr.com">Matthew</a>. Basically, without getting too deep into that, I made him feel like he was left out for a moment, search for a reason why I would do so, and end up on some pretty bad, sad, and mean reasons.</p>

<p>But then, magic happened.</p>

<p>When I came back to work with him, before we started, we had a conversation that kinda went like this :</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we start, do you mind if we talk for a second?<br/>
&ndash; Yeah sure, no problem, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, he ended up sharing what exactly happened, what he felt, what he saw, and what he feels now. I shared how I felt about it, explained and confirmed what he saw, and apologized. And that was an argument that was solved in less than 2 minutes, without any fight or hard  feeling.</p>

<p>This is what DBC made. DBC made us understanding human beings. DBC made Matthew not freak out about what happened, try to check what was happening, and then reflect. DBC made me listen, put myself in his shoes and be understanding.</p>

<p>I had an experience like that with my fiancee, and it is quite strange to realize that what you have been learning, no matter how true it was in your current environment, is actually true outside of it.</p>

<p>The first time I started listening like we try to do it here, it actually worked flawlessly. I tried again, it worked again. It may not work 100% of the time, but I know that I will keep on doing that for a while!</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/13/week-7-day-3-testing-again/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-13T09:03:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/13/week-7-day-3-testing-again</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Test driven development</h2>

<p>After a few days of testing, we started the test driven development on Rails.</p>

<p>The idea of test driven development is to make tests before you type any code. Let me give you a small example :</p>

<ul>
<li>Situation : I want to give a user the possibility to create an account</li>
<li><p>I write tests, from the biggest to the smallest:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test 1 : Fake an user that clicks user creation, then fill in the fields with correct info and click on the create button. The user should be taken back to the first page, and now he can login with these infos. (Integration tests)</li>
<li>Test 2 : Fake a request on the creation page, it should be defined and give a form.(controller test)</li>
<li>Test 3 : Fake a request on the route it takes after you click on the &ldquo;Create&rdquo; button. It should add a new User to the Database (Controller test)</li>
<li>Test 4 : The DB should not accept info that is not correct, so you test if it adds something when you try and push random invalid info to the DB (Model Unit Test)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Now I have that behavior, that I specified more and more, while writing the tests. Now, I can make the tests pass one by one. I start with Test 4, make these limits, then 3, 2, and finally 1.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>W00t? You have code that does exactly what you want, and that does not break! If you want to add code later, you just have to run the tests once this is finished, and make everything pass according to plan.</p>

<p>It tends to take a bit longer, but then you have a &ldquo;perfect code!&rdquo;. So do that!</p>

<h2>The new guys</h2>

<p>I spent a bit of time with the new cohort. They are awesome!</p>

<p>It is amazing to see that the tribe spirit is actually very different, once again. We had the &ldquo;University students&rdquo; Sea Lions, the &ldquo;Overachieving Kids&rdquo; Banana slugs, the &ldquo;Shy kids&rdquo; Golden bears, and now I think we have the &ldquo;Against-all-odds team&rdquo; fiery skippers.</p>

<p>Many of them don&rsquo;t come from computer science backgrounds, many are not the usual start-up 20-something american bearded dudes. But then, I am really impressed with the effort, and especially the team spirit they have. If one knows, one shares. Pairing is optional today? I heard : You can make bigger groups.</p>

<p>That is something I really resonate to, I just love it. They ask questions, try to know, show, learn, share, every verb I love ;)</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna hang around a lot even after graduation, because I think these skippers are going to impress me big time!</p>

<p>And Golden bears are good too, but I just think that individuality and shyness makes it harder. I am expecting good things to come out of the final group projects of the Bears, but I feel like they will struggle more than the skippers.</p>

<h2>My first full project</h2>

<p>So, I finished my project. You can see it live on : <a href="http://movie-shootings-in-sf.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>, and the code on <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev/shootings">Github</a>.
You can also check some of my tests on <a href="http://movie-shootings-in-sf.herokuapp.com/jasmine">Jasmine</a>.</p>

<p>It shows you a list of movies that have been shot in San Francisco. You try typing a movie title, and it autocompletes the movie title. It then geocodes every location where it has been shot, from the address that I am given by <a href="http://sfdata.org">Sfdata</a>, and pins them on the map.</p>

<p>Then, I make small popups info windows for when you click on the pin, with the director, location, name, year, and a link to IMDB to find the movie.</p>

<p>It is not that impressive, but I f*cking did it! I took 2 days (Plus 2 slacking with only one commit&hellip; oops), and I learned about things I did not know about :</p>

<ul>
<li>Flask</li>
<li>Jasmine + Sinon</li>
<li>Backbone</li>
<li>Google Maps API</li>
<li>Google Geocoding</li>
</ul>


<p>And now I feel good about it!</p>

    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/12/week-7-day-2-testing</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Yesterday we tested. We tested Rails for the first time, and it was not that hard. Many things are built-in, and the presence of gems like : <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers">shoulda-matchers</a> ended up making that day even easier than expected.</p>

<p>The idea behind testing your code is that you don&rsquo;t want it to break later. Now that you are working on that 100 lines project, you don&rsquo;t feel the need to do so, but what about when it hits 10000 lines and the 10001 actually breaks something in the middle? And what if solving that bug actually creates new ones?</p>

<p>So, to prevent that&hellip; We test. We test that an user can create an account, that it is correctly saved. We test that an user can login, that our password verification does not send unencrypted passwords, that the posts we make are not duplicates, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>All that, in 3 big groups :</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration tests : Complicated to do (Use <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> for Ruby web frameworks like Sinatra or Rails), and very long to execute. The idea is that you make a program do exactly what an user would do, to make sure every step works</li>
<li>Controller tests : This is a bit &hellip; fuzzy. These are considered as integration tests, or unit tests, depending on the piece of code you&rsquo;re testing, but of specific actions of the &ldquo;controller&rdquo; in your app. For example, when a user sends data to /users/new it should create a new user. They are faster than integration test, but still not the fastest</li>
<li>Model (Unit) tests : The idea here is to test the basic data you have. You have one single piece of data, a User, a Post, a Category, and you want to test that its data is the one you want. You want to test that a User can&rsquo;t have an email without an @ for example.</li>
</ul>


<p>This, we did it in Ruby, with <a href="http://rspec.info">Rspec</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers">shoulda-matchers</a>, and some others. I then did that in Javascript with <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine">Jasmine</a> and <a href="sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a>, for a small part of the evening.  All in all, it was a nice day, and now nothing breaks anymore ;)</p>

<h2>A video</h2>

<p>A tradition here in Dev Bootcamp says that people who are graduating from phase 2 need to prepare a video for the newcomers of the next monday. The video shows a bit about the bootcamp, the spirit, and the people that you can meet there&hellip; So without further introduction, ours :</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://Qt-dev.github.io//www.youtube.com/embed/AabGP9yvJ7o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>Naps</h2>

<p>Nowadays, I am a bit tired. I had no idea that we had to change the clocks on sunday, and discovered that after a very short night&hellip; Unfortunately, I was busy so I ended up doing a lot of things and not sleeping enough.</p>

<p>I am working on that, but since Monday, I am napping every afternoon now!<br/>
I hope I can make that be less of a habit soon&hellip; So I&rsquo;ll go to sleep now ;)</p>

    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/week-7-rails</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Phase 3</h2>

<p>So, first, sorry for not giving any news for friday. If I had to sum friday up, it would probably go like : &ldquo;Partayyyyyyyyyyy&rdquo;.<br/>
Phase 3 was graduating and showing us projects they worked on. Phase 1 and 2 were moving on to the next phase, so everybody just &hellip; had fun&hellip; and a lot of alcohol. If I can find the links to the projects I&rsquo;ll let you know, but in short we had :</p>

<ul>
<li>A social app for street performers to share their videos and people to tip them,</li>
<li>An app that tracks your bad (but legal) substance abuse (coffee, alcohol, cigarette)</li>
<li>An app that helps you keep track of all the online courses you can take and all the ones you take.</li>
<li>An app that helps independent music teacher track everything about their business</li>
</ul>


<p>Yesterday we started phase 3 and we started working on Rails&hellip;  Basically, if I had to say anything about it, I would say : Take everything we did so far, and now stop doing it because everything is generated automatically in rails!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll have fun, and play with a few things for 8 days, then group projects. That sounds awesome and I can&rsquo;t wait ;)</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>So, group projects are approaching&hellip; I have ideas, and my #1 would be to join Chermaine and work on the project we thought about together. But then, I also want to pitch a lot of ideas so I guess I&rsquo;ll try and share the ideas and see how it goes! Not right now, but I will, I promise!</p>

<p>Then, on the weekend, I learned 4 things :<br/>
&ndash; How to use Flask (A Python equivalent of Sinatra)
&ndash; How to compress WebAssets (And not have 10000000 js files here and there, even though your code is full of clear small classes for example&hellip;)
&ndash; How to play with Backbone (A Javascript framework to make whole apps on the front-end)
&ndash; How to play with Google Maps (Put a map of the site and pin stuff to it, geocode stuff, etc&hellip;)</p>

<p>And with that, I ended up making an app. It is an app that shows you all the movie shooting locations in San Francisco, by movie. It is not perfect or finished (I expect it to be finished tonight) but so far you can see :<br/>
&ndash; The site : <a href="http://movie-shootings-in-sf.herokuapp.com/">http://movie-shootings-in-sf.herokuapp.com/</a>
&ndash; The code : <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev/shootings">https://github.com/Qt-dev/shootings</a></p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll tell you when it&rsquo;s over, but you can check it out for now!</p>

<h2>Another first day in DBC</h2>

<p>Yesterday, the new cohort started. It feels so strange to be in the seniors&hellip;</p>

<p>They seem pretty interesting and interested. I think they have a very different dynamic than the Golden bears, and again, very different than the Banana Slugs too. I can&rsquo;t wait until I get to know them and learn more about them!</p>

<p>No worries though, I still love the golden bears, and more than that, I love the banana bears!</p>

<p>Now, time to go back to eating cookies and coding.
See you tomorrow!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Rest</h2>

<p>When I say rest, I don&rsquo;t mean sleeping all day&hellip; Yesterday, we had to finish some challenges that we had been given a few days before, had a couple of lectures, and then I worked on personal projects here and there. This is what I call rest.</p>

<p>In the end, that was a fruitful day, and a happy one too! I spoke with some people I had never met in the bootcamp, got some info on after-DBC, I learned stuff about languages and frameworks I did not know&hellip; AND, I congratulated my mother for her very happy birthday ;)</p>

<h2>Personal projects</h2>

<p>You can check my github for that. I have a few projects I had been dying to work on, and having some time to do so may make me finish a lot of them really fast!</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t tell you all about them yet, but I can tell you I expect to have a lot of stuff to do and to use them as a way to show the world my progress!</p>

<p>In the end, these are the things that make you look different, and make the people want to hear about you, and why not even hire you!</p>

<h2>DBC Life</h2>

<p>RAO HAS NO BEARD ANYMORE!</p>

<p>Apart from that, DBC life is fun. It was a slow day, fun things, but then the results of the assessments also kicked in, people dealt with that, and that was a big day for everybody.</p>

<p>And in the end, if I had to keep one sentence from yesterday, I would say :
If you have a lesson to get from DBC, it should be &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything, but that&rsquo;s ok&rsquo;.</p>

<p>No matter how much we learn here, when we get out, we&rsquo;re gonna be asked about what we don&rsquo;t. And we are not going to be asked to know stuff, but to show we can learn, and we don&rsquo;t freak out when we don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>So the lesson would be : Stop stressing out, and learn how to google ;)</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/06/week-6-day-3-oauth/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-06T09:23:33-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/06/week-6-day-3-oauth</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Oauth</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">Oauth</a> is a system used in authentification on the web nowadays.</p>

<p>The idea is that authenticating is easy, with password and username/email/name/whatever-id-you-want. But this is not secure enough. Plus, people get tired of logging on every site they use.</p>

<p>Oauth came out in 2010, when people were trying to remedy to that problem with different theories, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> being one of them.</p>

<p>So in the end, they came up with this way to identify an user on one site, and share that identification on every app authorized by this site and the user.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain the process a bit :</p>

<ul>
<li>The app maker registers on the giver&rsquo;s site (Twitter, Facebook, &hellip;)</li>
<li>The giver&rsquo;s site give the app maker a private <strong>API Token</strong>, a code that can be use to identify that app when it talks with the giver&rsquo;s site.</li>
</ul>


<p>&hellip;Time passes&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>An user comes on the site, tries to log in</li>
<li>The app redirects to the giver&rsquo;s site where the user is asked to log in. In the background, the app gives the <strong>API Token</strong> on the way, as a proof that the user is coming from there.</li>
<li>The user authorizes his account to be linked/identified on this app. The giver&rsquo;s saves that decision.</li>
<li>The giver&rsquo;s site sends back a <strong>User Token</strong> to the app.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, the app has an <strong>API Token</strong> and a <strong>User Token</strong>.
Using these 2, the app can ask the giver&rsquo;s site for info (last tweets? send tweet?), and while this is true, the user is authenticated on the site.</p>

<p>In the end, the user only has to login once, and nobody has the user password or anything. And anytime somebody&rsquo;s info is asked for, the giver&rsquo;s site verifies that the asking app has the rights.</p>

<p>This, ladies and gentlemen, is what we played with yesterday ;)
This : <a href="http://blooming-reaches-2179.herokuapp.com">Tweet from Heroku</a> is an example ;)</p>

<h2>Other languages / Frameworks</h2>

<p>The world of development is full of a lot (really&hellip; a tremendous amount) of languages and frameworks. People don&rsquo;t use them the same way, in the same places, but I can tell you that to do one thing, you have multiple tools in development.</p>

<p>In DBC, we learn about Ruby, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, mostly. We cover a few framework for each of those too. But in the end, we are not here to learn languages.</p>

<p>No good developer knows one language by heart.<br/>
&hellip; Let me rephrase and split that that:</p>

<ul>
<li>A good developer does not know fully a language, knowing that is what makes him really good.</li>
<li>A good developer learns new languages/frameworks all the time. One does not &ldquo;know one&rdquo;, but learns many.</li>
</ul>


<p>I try to work on that and get the second part up and running, and that is really fun. Also, using tools made by and for other people is really eyes opening. I love it.</p>

<p>I had ideas about that yesterday and I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll learn a bit more about the languages I already approached but did not use that much as soon as I have 5 minutes (probably this weekend).</p>

<h2>A fun day with Armando</h2>

<p>Yesterday, we paired with Armando again.<br/>
I was looking forward to it. He has been down for a bit, with a lack of self confidence and some doubts about his skills, and I was looking forward to doing my best to work on helping him with that.</p>

<p>Well, you know what? He f*cking rocks! We had fun the whole day, finished most of the challenges, and the best part :<br/>
Teachers did not try and assess him. And if they don&rsquo;t, that means that THEY don&rsquo;t doubt him. And one thing that I know :<br/>
If the person that&rsquo;s making it hard on you, teaching you, and taught hundreds before, has no doubt about you&hellip; that probably means you should stop doubting and assume you do (not really fully) know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/05/week-6-day-2-observer-design-pattern/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-05T09:22:11-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/05/week-6-day-2-observer-design-pattern</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Observer Design Pattern</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Design patterns</a> are a very important thing in Development. The idea is that experienced developers came up with the idea that no matter the language, the experience, the software they were building, they always ended up on the exact same problems. And then they came up with a &ldquo;simple solution&rdquo; for that, simpler than the problem at least.</p>

<p>So, they came up with design patterns they could use next time they would encounter that same problem. Many of them are useful mainly in statically typed languages like Java or C, but most of them are actually useful, for your own logic development, and for the time you might have to end up using these languages.</p>

<p>Also, since it is a pretty complicated notion, it does show people (like recruiters&hellip;) that you actually know what you are talking about, which is not a bad thing right?</p>

<p>Yesterday, I did a lightning talk about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer Pattern</a>. The idea is that it is a solution to the problem :</p>

<ul>
<li>I have objects that must be aware of changed of a particular object</li>
</ul>


<p>The solution is pretty simple. You actually give all the info to the observed (called observable) object.</p>

<ul>
<li>The observer gets an &ldquo;update&rdquo; method that will be triggered by the observable with the info it sent.</li>
<li>The observable gets a &ldquo;notify&rdquo; method that triggers the update method of the observers</li>
<li>The observable has a list of observers and relative methods (add/remove/number of them)</li>
</ul>


<p>And that is it. According to the language you&rsquo;ll use, you will have modules to do so (<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html">Observable in Ruby</a>), Interfaces (like some implementations in Java), but the idea will always be the same.</p>

<p>Now go on and play with it !</p>

<h2>Engineering Empathy Aftermath</h2>

<p>We still have Engineering Empathy in phase 2. Yesterday was the last session, about what triggers us and how to respond accordingly.</p>

<p>I did use that without even knowing about what I was doing. The idea is that when something triggers you, you stop, breathe, think about what&rsquo;s happening, then select the best response and respond. I tend to do that myself, mostly because I am overthinking everything.</p>

<p>Now, yesterday was also 3rd EE session for the phase 1, the Golden Bears. It is a really strong and heavy session, even though it is also a very liberating one. I felt like I wanted to be there for the people and so I spent my evening with anybody I could find, and that was nice.</p>

<p>They are affected, but they seem ok&hellip; You may find it strange, but just like a big brother about his younger siblings, I feel relieved to see they are doing fine&hellip;</p>

<h2>Looking for a job</h2>

<p>Things are going well at DBC, but yesterday I had a bit of time and ended up thinking about jobs. After all, that is one of the endpoint of this program, a reason why I came here.</p>

<p>I know that before I came here, hired was the only site I tried to join, and I just not being accepted. But now, things have changed. I have good proofs of what I can do, I have more mastery, people that can vouch for me&hellip;</p>

<p>I am thinking about that way in advance, but I feel like I want and have to. Being a foreigner, these things may be trickier, so I need to be better, and faster.</p>

<p>So now, time to work on side project to show my worth, and then use that!</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/04/week-6-day-1-more-oojs/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-04T09:07:05-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/04/week-6-day-1-more-oojs</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>More OOJS</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I paires with Harry. We have a great dynamic going on and we ended up building a good MVC system on Javascript for one of the challenges we had.</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t necessary get it so by the end of the week I&rsquo;ll try to send some code that I came up with for private projects, as an example.</p>

<p>As for the rest, we had a lot of fun and played with that a bit, to the point that we ended up falling short on a problem that apparently many people have. It feels good to not feel like you&rsquo;re outside of that whole development world ;)</p>

<p>The problem we had was : We made a Controller class, and just to Namespace and separate concerns, all the AJAX calls were used from the Ajax Controller, a class of its own.</p>

<p>Now the problem we hit is :</p>

<ul>
<li>Who calls the Ajax controller? &ndash;> The controller</li>
<li>What does the Ajax controller in case of a successful request?  &ndash;> The controller</li>
</ul>


<p>That is a problem, how do you link two objects when you can not create both at the exact same time?<br/>
And so our solution was to pass one as the argument to the other (The Ajax Controller knows about the controller), and then add the Ajax Controller to the controller</p>

<p><strong>In demonstration : </strong></p>

<pre><code class="js">
var AjaxController = function(controller){
    this.controller = controller;
}
// Do stuff with the ajax Controller

var Controller = function(){}
// Do stuff with the Controller

$(document).ready(function(){
    var controller = new Controller();
    var ajaxController = new AjaxController({ 
        controller: controller // First link
    })
    controller.ajaxController = ajaxController; // Link back
})
</code></pre>


<p>In the end, that looks very hack-ish. But then it is actually a question that people have nowadays : How do you do that? And like every good programming problem : There is no right or wrong answer ;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stick with that for now.</p>

<h2>APIs</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a> are interfaces for your program to be able to play with some web apps around. The idea is that instead of posting status via Facebook, you build an app that can do that for you somewhere else. The link between that App and Facebook is that API.</p>

<p>Your app will send a message to Facebook saying (write_status) and that will write the status.</p>

<p>Yesterday we started playing with Twitter and that was fun, and today we play on more&hellip; So expect some nice links in the near future ;)</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>I feel like DBC changes people. Not necessarily in the best way, but that does change people anyway.</p>

<p>I feel changed, I AM changed. But then, you will be able to see that the next time you meet me ;)</p>

<p>I am more confident, deal with my problems a more logical way, I empathize more with my peers&hellip; All in all, I like to think I took the good in that program. I may also have taken the bad, but then I don&rsquo;t know about that yet&hellip; Only time will tell!</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/01/week-5-day-5-awesome-project/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-03-01T12:01:41-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/03/01/week-5-day-5-awesome-project</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Awesome project</h2>

<p>Yesterday we had our second group project of phase 2. The idea of this one is : create a new version of <a href="https://surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a>. This time, we could choose our groups. Just like &hellip; most of the time. I checked around, saw Armando, he nodded, and we&rsquo;re in the same group!
We grouped with Henry, a new guy who repeated our phase, that I had not had the chance of talking with so far, Chermaine, who I had yet to pair with (really sorry >.&lt;), even though we&rsquo;re in the same accountability group (A group of 3 students of the same cohort that have to take care of each other), and Chris Woodrich, who is really an awesome dude, even though we end up messing with each other all the time.</p>

<p>Armando came with the awesome team name : The Ultimate Amazing Super Best Friends!</p>

<p>You can check how our project is going on : <a href="https://github.com/chriswoodrich/TUASBF/">https://github.com/chriswoodrich/TUASBF/</a></p>

<p>We have an awesome dynamic, we&rsquo;re all very happy to work with each other, and the project is really going well. I can&rsquo;t wait til we present it on monday!</p>

<h2>MVC Javascript</h2>

<p>I won&rsquo;t talk for hours about that, I&rsquo;ve been talking about it for days so you&rsquo;re probably tired about it already, but Javascript is to be used with an object oriented programming style. You can do it, and if you don&rsquo;t you will end up having a lot of troubles.</p>

<p>Now, we work on small JS projects here and there and even though I had some trouble finding where some part of my code would go (View or Controller for the listeners etc&hellip;). Now I do know and I really like it.</p>

<p>I could spend hours explaining how to do stuff, but instead, I&rsquo;ll just say : I do it, I like it, I can explain it if you want, and I&rsquo;ll try to release some code where I do that on my <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev">Github</a> whenever I can.</p>

<h2>Cohort tribe spirit</h2>

<p>A few things that Sherif (The guru that taught us in phase 1 haha) told us :</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;If you think that you can become developers in 9 weeks, you are insane. All of you. But then, that is that common insanity that will take you there. It is that shared insanity that will make you actually succeed in that.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You are a tribe. You are seen as such, you have a tribe spirit that is the way people and feel your whole group. Every cohort has a different spirit, and gives a different feeling&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>These ideas will not be surprising to anybody who knows the guy. Now, we had a few nice talk about this.</p>

<p>Nowadays, we have 3 cohorts in DBC. The Sea Lions, in phase 3, the Banana Slugs (US!) in phase 2, and Golden Bears in phase 1.
And apparently, even just these 3 have a VERY different spirit.</p>

<p>Sea Lions are apparently like university students. Their first instinct is more to work alone, even though they don&rsquo;t have any problem in forming groups in need be.</p>

<p>The Banana Slugs are seen as overachieving kids. We are the kind of kids that say things like &ldquo;Oh look dad, a mountain! Look at me I&rsquo;ll go climb the thing faster that anybody else!&rdquo;. We crave on challenges that we can work on together and just be as awesome as one could be! Haha</p>

<p>The Golden Bears are much more &ldquo;shy&rdquo;. Compared to us and our 2 hours of questions and ideas exchanges that we had to timebox everyday, the echo I get from some of them I talked to and from their instructors is that they are very silent and studious.</p>

<p>At the end, none of us is right or wrong, but seeing that big of a difference in such a short amount of time is really interesting.</p>

<p>But then, the idea is that the presence of all of these people is what is actually helping us get to the end. We work 15 hours a day, something I would NEVER have thought would happen before coming here. We support each other, help each other, and at the end I think that Sherif was actually right, that common insanity that makes us stay that late, that makes us work our asses off without even realizing that, is what takes us where we are.</p>

<p>We learned Javascript/Object Oriented JS in one week, Everything we could about Sinatra, MVC WebApp frameworks, and all that in one week&hellip; That happens only in such conditions and I am really grateful about that!</p>

    <link href="http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/02/28/week-5-day-4-small-and-repetitive-projects/"/>
    
    <updated>2014-02-28T09:48:47-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://Qt-dev.github.io/blog/2014/02/28/week-5-day-4-small-and-repetitive-projects</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Small and repetitive code</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I worked on portfolio projects. They are projects to check if you know about what we&rsquo;ve been using, for yourself or for the teachers. They are small, easy, and fun&hellip; And everything is relative, like Einstein said.</p>

<p>One of the project was hard, but not because of the complicated content, but because of the amount of repetitive code we had to do.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get the bad idea though, the challenge was cool, but it was about making a big bunch of code that we have been making for 2 weeks now. I did it late, and because of that I just ended up having to re do again, instead of doing it in the middle of my learning.</p>

<p>Anyway, the thing I got from that challenge is : Code is repetitive! That&rsquo;s why people take and make shortcuts. Sometimes, you have to make the same thing again, a few times, and that sucks. Copy pasting and all that works, but in this particular context, it did not&hellip;</p>

<h2>DB Constraints</h2>

<p>I did a lightning talk about DB Constraints. The idea is that the apps that we build with Ruby On Rails, Sinatra, Nodejs, or all these things, use tools that allow you to not have to deal with database languages and small tasks by yourself.</p>

<p>But then, people tend to forget that in the end, we ARE working with databases. And what if one day your app falls apart? What if you want to change some portion of your code, among which is the DB reader thingy?</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t put any constraints on your database, then you have a problem because now people can use empty username, 1230912301921309 characters numbers, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>So to prevent that, put constraints!
When I say constraints, you can limit your 4 things (or 5) :</p>

<ul>
<li>:limit : Works for binary, numbers, strings, and texts, and set the max number of characters</li>
<li>:null : Allows (Or not allow, if you give it false) this column to have a null entry in it</li>
<li>:default : Give a default value to that field when none is entered</li>
<li>:precision / :scale : Specifies the number of digits you can give, and the number of digits after the decimal</li>
</ul>


<p>See? That was not hard!</p>

<p>Now, go ahead and go read : <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements/add_column">this</a>.</p>

<h2>Connecting</h2>

<p>One thing we do here is connecting. We spend all of our time together, we are now a huge family where everybody has to know and live with everybody.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Irene and I &ldquo;cashed in&rdquo; my free meal from Sherif, our big first phase teacher that we don&rsquo;t see much because we&rsquo;re in phase 2 now, because we finished our sudoku solver that solves 170 sudokus in less than a minutes (8.5 seconds whaddup!).<br/>
That was really fun, we ate a lot, and learnt a lot&hellip; again. Incredible, when he is &ldquo;off duty&rdquo;, we learn a lot from him!</p>

<p>He told us a lot about how he had trouble connecting with the new cohort and I feel bad for them.</p>

<p>Today, I went/am going to eat with Strand, and that is awesome. He&rsquo;s a 2nd phase teacher and I feel like I&rsquo;m connecting with everybody and I love it ^.^</p>
