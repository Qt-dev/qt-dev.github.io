  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lsquo;twas the day before the end of the phase. People were happy, exhausted, and alcohol and songs mixed up to help the moods enlighten.<br/>
Week 3 Day 5, everybody has had his assignment. The outcome of these assignments is just an advice, then people had time to make their choices. Some of our cohort (2 I think, but we&rsquo;ll get the confirmation on monday) chose to go back to work on the same phase again, not feeling ready for the next one yet yet. Most chose to go on to the next level of difficulty. And That applies for phase 1 as for phase 2.</p>

<p>One thing to know is that there are 2 differences between a phase and the next one.<br/>
The first difference is : The next one is always more difficult that the current one. It starts higher, has a higher rhythm, everything will be harder.<br/>
The second one is : The next phase will get harder much faster that the current. You start higher, and you&rsquo;ll have more work, to do in less time. More projects, and you&rsquo;ll have to learn things faster, and better.<br/>
Behold, fellow students, winter is not coming, Mayhem is.</p>

<p>Now, on the last friday of each phase, everybody knows where they&rsquo;re going, phase 1, phase 2, phase 3. Everybody finished their projects, presented what they wanted, and now they just have to &ldquo;wait&rdquo; for monday. So on this friday, we get beer, pizzas, mics, music on the big screen, and we partayyyyy~</p>

<p>Wait is a big word though, everybody who was in this program will tell you that. New material, new studies and all that are on the next monday so on this weekend, people are stressed out and tend to study as much as they can about the new stuff we&rsquo;ll have to deal with on the next monday.</p>

<p>For me, I spent one day discovering stuff. I went to Target, Whole Foods. I went to the Chinese New year&rsquo;s parade in San Francisco. And now, I am studying a bit about Sinatra and stuff. Things are going well, but I prefer resting before the mayhem. It&rsquo;ll get crazy whatever I do, so I might as well just rest before that ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, see you on tuesday for news about monday&hellip; And the new cohort! And Welcome to the Golden Bears!</p>

<p>(PS : Marching bands are AWESOME! :</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s me sum some stuff up first before I start :</p>

<ul>
<li>Gem : A Gem is a &ldquo;library&rdquo;, a pack of code, in the programmatic language we call Ruby, that enables us to use functions not built in the languages without having to rewrite the code. When one feels he has enough code to share, he can wrap it up in a &ldquo;Gem&rdquo; that will be easily installable and usable by the other Ruby programmers.</li>
<li>Faker : Faker is a gem that basically gives you random data. Let&rsquo;s say you want to make a huge database and want to test the load for when you have more than 1000 users. Instead of writing either 1000 times the same name or use 1000 names you write one by one, Faker will generate a random one for each of these entries. Pretty useful.</li>
</ul>


<p>But then, Faker generates what it has been built for. Generating team names, or even slogans, are not what it has been made for. So as a 2 days project with my fellow boots of Phase 1 DevBootcamp we created one that made the things we want. You can check the code here : <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev/cool-faker">Github</a>, and more info on how to download the gem on : <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/cool_faker">Rubygem</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, we used <a href="http://bundler.io/v1.5/rubygems.html">bundle</a> to make the gem architecture, the files we needed. Then, we took a look at how Faker was built and decided to go around that same way, with our data stocked in a yaml file, and using the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html">yaml</a> module to load it and get the data we wanted in ruby.</p>

<p>And we end up with a gem that has 4 different functions :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="ss">CoolFaker</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Character</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>generates a random Character name from a famous movie, or tv show. The titles include The Lord of the Ring, Superman, Starwars, friends, or futurama.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="ss">CoolFaker</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Character</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name_from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">movie_or_tv_show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>generates a random name from the movie or tv show that you called.
Your options are :</p>

<ul>
<li>friends</li>
<li>entourage</li>
<li>sex_and_the_city</li>
<li>batman</li>
<li>startrek</li>
<li>superman</li>
<li>star_wars</li>
<li>the_lord_of_the_rings</li>
<li>napolean_dynamite</li>
<li>snow_white</li>
<li>back_to_the_future</li>
<li>the_wizard_of_oz</li>
<li>toy_story</li>
<li>the_simpsons</li>
<li>futurama</li>
<li>monty_python</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="ss">CoolFaker</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Team</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">slogan</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>generates a random slogan from a 587 quotes database</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="ss">CoolFaker</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Team</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>generates a team name from a list of adjectives and a list of animal names. Expect some funny names, gender-confused pandas is a good one ;)</p>

<p>With all that, we ended up making the gem with a simple</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="n">build</span> <span class="n">cool_faker</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gemspec</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And then send it to rubygems.org, and here we go.</p>

<p>All in all, we ended up shipping a gem without knowing about gem building/shipping, building dozens of tests without knowing about rspec&hellip; a good 2 days of intense learning, a lot of fun, and we end up with an usable tool. I&rsquo;m pretty happy about it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Group Project</h2>

<p>Yesterday we started a new group project. This time, it&rsquo;s a 2 days stretch. You can follow how it&rsquo;s going on <a href="https://github.com/Qt-dev/cool-faker">Github</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is that we are building an open-source project. More specifically, we are building a Ruby Gem (A code library, a set of tools for people who use ruby) that will generate random people names, team names, and useful info like that from a database of funny and famous words/names/quotes. The idea is that there is a gem called &ldquo;Faker&rdquo;, and we are building the cool version of this one, with Armando, Jamie, and Nicholas.</p>

<p>So far, it&rsquo;s doing good! I got my voice back so I can participate much more in whiteboarding and all that, we planned everything decently and managed to get an MVP (Minimum Viable Product, the smallest thing you could build on your idea) in half the time. We&rsquo;re pushing for more options and some kind of implementation to show nice usage of that gem.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to be working on some tool that may very well be used by others all around the world. Plus, learning how to make gems is a very interesting thing. I think that when I have time later, I&rsquo;ll try to make some gems just for the sake of helping around. Open-source is awesome!</p>

<h2>Good news</h2>

<p>Among the good news :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I may see my fiancee before I come back. This is by far the best news I could ever had heard. I miss her, and knowing that I may see her sooner than I expected is just the best thing that could have happened.</p></li>
<li><p>I had a beer with Jonathan and got more info about after Dev Bootcamp. That was such a relief. Coming here as a frenchman, I just had no idea how the job market was, and how things were supposed to happen after that. I kinda get ideas from here and there, but finally being able to have some feedback from a guy who has the same experience, and comes from the same place, is really a relief. Now I just have to continue giving my best &lsquo;til the end of these 9 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m going to Phase 2! I got my assessment and it went ok. I overthought part of it so I wouldn&rsquo;t say I did perfectly, but with the goal being : Assess whether I know Phase 1 material or not, I did ok for that. That is perfect! So now it&rsquo;s time to learn even more!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, going back to the project&hellip; See you tomorrow!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Engineering Empathy Cooldown</h2>

<p>Two days ago was our last Engineering Empathy session of Phase 1. Like the other cohort told us : &ldquo;You thought the first session was heavy? Wait &lsquo;til you see session 3&rdquo;.</p>

<p>First week was &ldquo;The superego&rdquo;, and the exercise that we got was &ldquo;Share what your inner voice tells you&rdquo;. This week was &ldquo;Dive deeper in what you let people know about you&rdquo;&hellip; And so we sat in circle to tell people stuff, while starting every sentence with &ldquo;If you really knew me&rdquo;. Now let me tell you guys&hellip; There were tears, hugs, revelations, but no shocked reaction, no judgement, nothing like that. And everything told in this room stays in this room.</p>

<p>Diving deeper than the usual in what you tell people is an exercise that does make us grow, but that also hits you hard at the moment you do it. And listening to all of the others&#8217; is not even easier. I think I can safely say that I will keep that day in my mind for a very very long time.</p>

<h2>ActiveRecord</h2>

<p>ActiveRecord is the design pattern I told you about yesterday. In Rails, the most well known web framework for Ruby, this design pattern is implemented in its own. What it does, in short, is mapping a database with an object. Columns of the database become attributes of the objects, you can create objects and save them to the db, or get objects from an entry in the db. Quite easy and practical!</p>

<p>Yesterday, we worked on that for the whole day. The morning was the introduction, and the afternoon the application. I&rsquo;ll say that it was a pretty good day, I learned a lot, and ActiveRecord is cool&hellip; Wait&hellip; Better than that : ActiveRecord is coolER than SQL!</p>

<h2>My first solo day</h2>

<p>Wednesdays are optional solo days. That means that every other day, we have to pair or group with more people, but on wednesdays, we choose our pairs/groups. I did not solo until then, but I thought that to save my voice I&#8217;ld try and do so yesterday.</p>

<p>In the end, I did finish the exercises, which was my goal. I had to go to other people soloing a couple of times, to get my mind off of the problems that were blocking me, and to help me figure out solutions sometimes, but I did it and I am pretty happy about it.</p>

<p>The beginning was hard and I just &hellip; felt like I did not know where I was going. But I got on it after I expressed my incomprehension a first time, and then I just worked, with a decent speed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll do that again, probably not next week, but probably another time. It was a good day but I prefer picking my pairs in the people I do well with (Looking at you Irene!).</p>

<p>Anyway, today is assessment and group project&hellip; time to have fun !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>More SQL</h2>

<p>Yesterday was another day when we used SQL, apparently the last (Yay!). We implemented our own version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern">ActiveRecord</a>, a tool used in Rails that we will, apparently, use all the time and that will be the one talking with the base. But to use your tools correctly you first have to learn how they were built&hellip; And so that is what we did.</p>

<p>I paired with Erin for this day and it was really great. We had a good dynamic and we ended up finishing everything without any real problem going on. All in all, it was a great day for Quentin in DBC!</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Shadi is back! So testing is back too ;)<br/>
He explained how to make our own version of Rspec, the testing suite for Ruby, and then handed us a series of tests for the exercises we had for the day. Things are getting complicated pretty fast, but I love it !</p>

<p>Testing is getting trickier but soon enough we&rsquo;ll get into some deep Rspec testing and for the newcomers : TESTING IS IMPORTANT! TEST ALL THE TIME!</p>

<h2>Cookies and Syrup</h2>

<p>So, I came here thinking americans ate junk food and only junk food. Such a disappointment to be in a house, in a program, and in a city where it is absolutely not the case!<br/>
I ended up being on some kind of sugar withdrawal in a few days, that is absolutely not the thing I would have suspected.</p>

<p>So, to compensate that, I buy cookies! And then, once or twice a day, take my usual bite. But then, I am now seen as some sort of cookie monster for eating a lot more than any other around&hellip; So strange.</p>

<p>As for the syrup, small but funny story : Ivan bought syrup, I took some (The throat is not 100% ok yet), then I got incredibly sleepy, and slept. The bad part is that it was 9AM and I was fighting sleep in the middle of a very interesting lecture on Testing.<br/>
The conclusion I got from that is : Read the fucking manual. Don&rsquo;t take syrup without reading all about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>SQL</h2>

<p>In the world of development, we could say that you have plenty of choices when picking your tools. Among these tools are hundreds, if not thousands, of languages. Some are pretty specifically used, even though they may not have been made for, some are pretty &ldquo;fast&rdquo; while others are &ldquo;not&rdquo;&hellip; But all in all, we can say that a hammer is a hammer. No matter the brand or the specs, the hammer will fulfill his role and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday we used SQL for the second time in phase 1. It is a language used to talk to a specific type of database (Any derivation of SQL), which may very well be one of the most common database type in the world, and that has been the case for more than 20 years. The language used to do so has been around for almost the same time too&hellip;<br/>
I paired with Tim, a very nice and tall guy, and we ended up doing as much as we could for the day. We learned tons, we played a bit, and it was fun. All in all, a good day, even if we spent the day on SQL&hellip;</p>

<h2>Games</h2>

<p>So, Web Development, and maybe even particularly in Dev Bootcamp, is a world of hard work combined with games. My opinion is that we party, we play, we develop games even, to cope with the rest of the hard day. A lot of brain-twisting challenges and very not fulfilling days spent on solving that bugs that would have taken 2 minutes to solve if you had seen that semi-colon earlier will do that to you and may ask for harder entertainment.</p>

<p>In DBC, we play. There are games all around, the Giant Djenga falls a couple of times a day, we did a Hack-a-thon this weekend (A coding contest where teams build stuff and compare at the end of the day. All with beer, pizzas, and a lot of laughter), and all in all, people are playful.</p>

<p>Yesterday we played Magic The Gathering with a couple of boots. I did not win but I loved the game. A long game, hard, where you have to think before you do stuff. It had been a long time and now I just regret I did not bring my cards myself ;)</p>

<h2>Assessments</h2>

<p>DBC is not about grading students. It is not the style of the house. But they do have to test us to make sure we can understand the next phase. So, to do that they assess us at the end of every phase.</p>

<p>This week is the end of the first Phase. Teachers will get with us for a short amount of time on Thursday and will review some of our code at this point. At this moment, no more help, just some control of your knowledge. At the end of that, we can be given one of 3 different options :</p>

<ul>
<li>Your level is high enough, welcome to Phase 2</li>
<li>You may want to spend 3 more weeks on Phase 1, just to make sure you get it all</li>
<li>Are you really sure you are learning anything? If not, DBC may not be the best thing for you&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, let&rsquo;s hope for mine being the first one! I&rsquo;ll do my best anyway.<br/>
Small info for the people in the next cohorts : We chose our assessments. The output may be the same but you may not get the same.</p>

<p>Anyway, lecture is about to start again, let&rsquo;s go. Thank you for reading and see you tomorrow!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently, getting sick is a trend among DBC cohorts. When you get here, expect to get sick. Bad weather this week, and me being very stupid with the weak points I know I have just made me get sicker than I do usually.<br/>
So, I ended up feverish, sleeping more or less the whole day&hellip; for 2 days, in DBC, waking up 5 minutes at a time, just enough to get some work done so that I don&rsquo;t feel too far behind, and then go back to sleep. Then I woke up on friday but had no more voice&hellip;<br/>
All in all, a good week of fun times.</p>

<p>In other news, we went through some SQL introduction. We will be using Postgres mostly. Now I just have to figure out if my experience with MySQL will be a good or a bad thing.
Different implementations of SQL can save you some time to get into the syntax, but then the small differences are what can just be the tricky things that make you get in so many bugs. Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Friday was the first group project, and we did a Tournament Manager. Again, I couldn&rsquo;t speak and was a bit dizzy so I ended up not being able to give my 100% and I hate that&hellip; Yesterday was the first DBC-Alumni hackathon and I was still not close enough to awake-ish to be able to participate. Damn throat&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry to my pairs this week for having my mind pretty far off the planet, sorry to my friends who I may make sick, to those who took time to help me get better when they clearly had better things to do, and to the people who may be reading this blog and had no food for thoughts for 4 days.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m back, I&rsquo;m good now, and hungry for knowledge, experience, and opportunities to show the world what I&rsquo;m made of!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>OOP</h2>

<p>Development is a wide topic to learn. New ways to do everything a developer need to do appear everyday. But then, the practices, the basis behind all of these new tools is slow and moves at a steady pace.<br/>
You can take it as :<br/>
&ndash; The tools are waves.<br/>
Thousands land on your shores everyday. None is exactly the same as another, every one of them is different, and to a surfer, a fisherman, or anybody who could make us of them, every one of them could be a treasure or a pain.<br/>
&ndash; The practices are ties.<br/>
They also come, but at a very slow pace. They too are very different, and affect anybody much more than waves, but because of that slow pace, we tend to focus less on that.</p>

<p>Well, today was the second day of introduction to Object Oriented Programming. One could probably spend hours writing about such a notion, but I will stick to a one sentence explanation.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented Programming</a> is a way to work in development by modeling blocks of code in what people call an &ldquo;Object&rdquo;. Wikipedia, among others, explains that much more easily than I do, I encourage you to get there to check what it is about. ;)<br/>
Plus, I don&rsquo;t have much interesting things to say about it so&hellip; I won&rsquo;t say much!</p>

<h2>Friends &amp; Brothers</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I paired with Jamie, a nice american-name, american-accent girl who does not look like her profile picture and who does NOT like country music (Hehe&hellip; Sorry for the private joke). In all honesty, it went well, and if it had been another person, I may have spent a bad time. The challenges were about things that I could not say I master, but an introduction is an introduction. We talked a lot, learned to know each other.<br/>
I find that extremely important when you spend most of the time with some people and you have to challenge, and spend most of your time in total freakout mode.</p>

<p>That being said, another part of the day was a bit harder. Dev Bootcamp makes you meet people that have been selected after a particular selection. Only 10% of the people make it apparently. Of course, we are selected because we have a specific set of skills, a particular mindset, and Karim and all the others in charge of admission see things in us that make them think we can make it.</p>

<p>Then, we get grouped with others with the same characteristics, and for 9 weeks, you work with them, play with them, more or less live with them, 100% of the time. During these 9 weeks, you are challenged everyday, stressed out to a point where most would break, and most DO break. Your challenge, just like the others, is to learn what took years or even decade to master to many. As <a href="https://github.com/amgando">Sherif</a> said, that is insane. We are insane for trying that, but then we have been selected because we are, and only that combined insanity of so many people can help us make it at the end.</p>

<p>In our cohort, we even took it so far as to get a house for 9 of us. If spending most of our times of struggle was not enough, we now spend 100% of our time together.</p>

<p>I may sound overdramatic with that explanation, but my point is that your only way to win at this is brotherhood( + sisterhood, however you say that). We are one, and must stay one. All of us must succeed at the end, and if one of us breaks, we all need to do our best to &ldquo;repair&rdquo; him asap to get on the next step.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Stephen had a bad time. Pressure got the best of him for a part of the afternoon. It was not the challenges, not something that happened yesterday, but something that grew in his head that ended up getting to him.<br/>
But what happened after that is the illustration of that idea that I am trying to give you : We gathered, and make it so that it never happens again. Stephen is part of us, the entity that we have become. We can&rsquo;t succeed without him, and will not let him behind. In the end most of us went to sleep at 12AM, after long talks, hugs, and mental-screwdriving.</p>

<p>To whoever want to join the bootcamp with any other idea that the one I am describing in here : You shall not pass. This is teamwork, and without that, none of you will pass. That is a fact, well known by those who succeeded as well as those who did not.<br/>
You will NEED brothers and sisters.</p>

<h2>Battleship &amp; Sudoku</h2>

<p>I already took too much of your time so I will try and be fast on this one but : Yesterday somebody pointed me in a new direction for sudoku solving. It is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links">Dancing Links</a>. I won&rsquo;t explain in details, especially since I don&rsquo;t think I have a good enough grasp on this, but my goal here is to try and solve the 170 puzzles I solved in 8.5 seconds, but in less than a second this time. I&rsquo;ll tell you more when I can.</p>

<p>And about Battleship : A few of us finished the challenge that said we had to make a battleship game in Ruby. We thought we could share that knowledge, so we got an idea and we are organizing a Battleship contest. We will build a core game, and a way for people to develop their players behaviors. We will be around the whole way and help those who could not finish it at first. Then after that we will just compete&hellip; But then again, we don&rsquo;t have the rules yet so&hellip; See you tomorrow!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>A new partner</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you meet people and you feel that it is just right. Yesterday I was to pair with Irene. There are not a lot of people I did not work with, but Irene was one of them. I was looking forward to pair with her, her experience with web dev, and the examples of work she had accomplished  is just impressing to me (Like this for instance : <a href="http://www.ireneyiu.com">Iren
So, we paired and it was a very fulfilling pairing session, in terms of partnership mainly. e&rsquo;s Site</a>)). Plus, so far I only heard nice things about her! In the end, I just loved my day, but you&rsquo;ll see more about that in the next paragraphs. Plus, she knows a bit of french (Every time she tries some french words I realize she knows even more than I thought, very impressive).  Some would say that I should not have been intimated, or even go as far as saying things about great minds thinking alike&hellip; But I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<h2>Experience vs Mastery</h2>

<p>For me, people make experience when working the right way, learning, experimenting, on one particular topic. There is no limit to how far you could go in such a topic, and broadening your learning will always take you to strange places, more skills, more experience, and for me, more fun!</p>

<p>Now, I do have some skills. I won&rsquo;t brag about it, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason to have some false modesty. I have, indeed, been playing with computers for 27 good years so far. I have been developing, at a slow pace for 2 years now. My job has also been to spot and maybe fix bugs in the program my company was making for the lat 2 years.<br/>
But all that does not make me a genius. The only thing it gets me is experience. No mastery, no great mind, nothing like that.<br/>
Irene has been doing some web development for a while, and that also does not make her a genius. She is, however, much more experienced than I am in web development, and web design. If you take Stephen, he is much more experienced in video games, and Armando in asian cuisine!<br/>
In the end, people have experience, and every experience is different. There is no shame in having none in one topic, and lack of experience should just push you to want to learn more.</p>

<p>In the end, I was too impressed by Irene, and I should not have, but we also both had that feeling that people tend to put us on pedestals because of some of our experience, sometimes. She was apparently just as intimidated, and in a way I think that helped us connect much more easily. All in all&hellip; Good times and a awesome pairing session, Sacrebleu!</p>

<h2>Sudoku!</h2>

<p>So, I made code that solves sudokus. Hunter had been working on an algorithm thought by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter Norvig</a>, former director of search quality at Google. As with the experience I was talking about in the 2nd paragraph, Hunter has much more than me in math and algorithm thinking and design.</p>

<p>The idea is that :<br/>
&ndash; You first fill in every cell that has only one possible value.<br/>
&ndash; You then take all the boxes, rows, and columns, and try to find if any possible values can take only one location in one of these groups, and then set it to this cell.<br/>
&ndash; If you did not find anything, just guess one number, taking all the cells with the smallest number of possible values, and fix them one by one, before calling the first step again. If it did not work, you get back on this part, restore the board, and fix the next one.</p>

<p>I could spend hours talking about that, but in the end&hellip; I solve 170 puzzles, among which 95 &ldquo;hards&rdquo;, and the 11 harvests, all that in 8.5 seconds.</p>

<p>If you want any more info, don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask. I think I&rsquo;ll be showing how I did to my cohort very soon anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Week review</h2>

<p>Ok so, it was the last day of the week, everybody is pretty messed up thanks to the huge amount of content, to the Engineer Empathy, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Yesterday, we started with a review session with Sea Lions, the cohort prior to us who&rsquo;s on the bootcamp with us. During that session, what came out was :</p>

<ul>
<li>Sea lions are happy to be around us</li>
<li>Week 1 of Phase 2 was awesome</li>
<li>Week 1 of Phase 1 was awesome, even though it was a bit overwhelming</li>
<li>Engineer Empathy affected every one of us, big time</li>
</ul>


<p>I could explain more right now but I think I&rsquo;ll just do a quick recap during the weekend if I can.</p>

<h2>Sudoku day!</h2>

<p>So, today was the last day of this first week of DBC. One of the &ldquo;initiation rituals&rdquo; of that first week seems to be that first friday theme : Sudoku. The idea is that we worked hard all week on challenges here and there, and on this friday they gave us the &ldquo;Ultimate challenge of the week&rdquo;. For this challenge, you have 2 assignments :</p>

<ul>
<li>In the morning, you have to write code that reads a sudoku data line, then builds a grid and solves it without guessing.</li>
<li>For the rest of the day&hellip; Implement guessing!</li>
</ul>


<p>I was to pair with Nic, a guy who chose to redo phase 0 to make sur he got all the knowledge he could get from it. But then, Nic already completed that challenge on the last cohort. So the rules we went for were :</p>

<ol>
<li>We don&rsquo;t check any of the code he did before</li>
<li>His thoughts may very well just end up being guided by what he already did, so I found the suggestions, he would just comment, agree, debate, etc&hellip;</li>
</ol>


<p>Let me tell you guys : That went well! We ended up implementing an object-oriented piece of code that actually ran faster (50%) than the one he had last year!</p>

<p>If you want more info on that :</p>

<p>We created a cell object that had the value for that cell, and all the info about its position as its attributes. This way, a simple <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Array.html-i-select"></a> call and we got all the cells in this array, in this row, or in this column.</p>

<h2>Geek talk : My take on people&rsquo;s solutions</h2>

<p>People actually implemented the same algorithm over and over again. To sum it up I&#8217;ld say :</p>

<ul>
<li>Select a cell</li>
<li>Get the values of the non-empty cells in the same row, column, and box</li>
<li>Subtract the values you found from an array of the possible values (1 to 9)</li>
<li>If there is only one remaining possible value, assign it to that space</li>
<li>Do it again until all the spaces are taken</li>
</ul>


<p>That was common for every one of us that I saw. But then the huge difference was : The data structure. You had to make a choice there that would make the code change big time, but let me explain that :<br/>
This data structure can be put in one of 3 different groups.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nested array. You make arrays in an array, and so you get a 2D array</li>
<li>Something hybrid from 1 and 3</li>
<li>Cells as an object that you put in an array</li>
</ol>


<p>Obviously, the 1 is the easiest way to go to put and get the data, right? And the last one may just end up being the most complicated one (What do I need my object to know? How do I create it? And how do I call the attributes of that object? Do I calculate them on the go? &hellip;).</p>

<p>Now, the interesting part is that, for this problem, the easiest the data structure, the hardest the rest of your code will be. Because when you have a nested array, how do you call a block? How about a column? How do you check if all the blank spaces have been filled? Do you do some kind of nested loop to go through your nested arrays?</p>

<p>But then if you chose the 3, this <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Array.html-i-select"></a> method just ends up selecting whatever you need in one line.</p>

<p>In the end, since the rest of the code was basically the same, the main difference was there.</p>

<p>If you check the code of people in the cohort, most of the people chose something around 2. Some were pushing in the direction of 3, some in the direction of 1, but mostly doing 2.</p>

<p>One did go through with 0 (Way to go Armando and Chermaine!), and one did actually do something that could be a &ldquo;0&rdquo; in my list : A simple array. You calculate the row,column and box from the index every time you need one of them.</p>

<p>Anyway, that was what I found and I would be happy to share more if you have any more question!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just end this post with this very profound quote :
&ldquo;Today was a good day&rdquo;</p>
