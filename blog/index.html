  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, yesterday, I graduated. I now have my very own dog tags with my name on it. I am &ldquo;officially&rdquo; a web developer. I will try to not spoil it too much for the people still in the program, but I do have to talk about this day.</p>

<p>If I had to sum that day up in one word, I&#8217;ld say : &lsquo;Tears&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The day started with the usual friday group checkins. What came out of that were that other cohorts were excited for everything new (every cohort is getting to the next phase on monday, DBC is moving, a new cohort is coming too&hellip;), and unhappy about us moving out. But then, like we told them again and again, we are not going anywhere.</p>

<p>After that, we presented our projects. A lot of clapping, a lot of laughing, and being impressed by every one of them. Also, for some reason, Rao discovered that I existed that very day, apparently. He asked me what was that necklace that I am wearing&hellip; But then I have been wearing that every single day for 3 years now&hellip; But that&rsquo;s fine, I still love him !</p>

<p>Then, we came back to coding&hellip; psych, we did not write a single line that day. We ate these things DBC had ordered for us (COOKIES!), and then I took a huge nap.</p>

<p>I got waken up when Steven, one of our teachers, was about to speak about a nice life lesson he got some time ago. I won&rsquo;t tell you the whole story but I will just sum it up with :<br/>
The day you start resenting everything about where you are, what you do, what you life looks like&hellip; Take a step back. Cash in on some money you have, and get out. Physically, mentally, it does not matter, just get out. I think this is a great advice that sometimes people just don&rsquo;t follow. I got stuck in France and ended up needing friends and family to pull me out because I had not plan any kind of exit strategy&hellip; Don&rsquo;t be me!</p>

<p>After that, we went to the park, and without telling you much about it, let&rsquo;s just say we had the chance to say what we thought about people. And I just wanted to say, from the bottom of my heart, that I hate you, banana slugs, so much for the amount of tears you made me cry! ;)</p>

<p>Let me give you a quick example of things I heard :</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Quentin, if I explained how much I like you in a sentence right now&hellip; That would mean I have not spent the 9 last weeks with you and did not know you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thanks to you, becoming a better person seems so easy&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I love your scarf&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>There were plenty of others, these are just the 3 ones that came to my mind right now, you probably get the tone anyway.</p>

<p>After that, we went back, and graduated. We were welcomed with that High-Five tunnel that greeted us the very first day, then they gave us our dog tags,&hellip; and we partied until 2 in the morning!</p>

<p>I spent almost all of my night trying to tell people how much I love them and how grateful I am that I met them. These 9 weeks were such an adventure&hellip;</p>

<h2>The end&hellip; ?</h2>

<p>Now, I am out, but what I feel is that the training ended, now it&rsquo;s time for the big game. I am never leaving these people, I will haunt them forever, at least just to thank them for how good they made me feel.</p>

<p>And if I end up making them happy one day in their lives, I will consider myself happy. And to all the DBC Staff, all the alumnus, all the current students, my cohort and the others, I am talking about all of you. You are SO going to regret making me feel that good ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>Tomorrow is the big day. I am writing this in advance to make sure I have time to do it before tomorrow ends, because I know that it is going to be crazy.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is my last day as a boot in Dev Bootcamp. After our usual friday group check-ins, our team will present our final project, then talk about the next week and job searching, and spend the rest of the day pretty much partying&hellip;</p>

<p>So, today, to prepare, we worked on the presentation. I was hesitating, wondering if I could speak about refactoring (I did a bit of that&hellip; I had a 5 hours streak on it, with 28 commits in the pull request at the end&hellip;), but I don&rsquo;t think it is as interesting as the other things to talk about. At some points, we have to make choices, right?</p>

<p>I will be talking about the javascript part of that app. Basically, since I worked a lot on the connection between pages in javascript, I will be explaining how I built the whole engine. Also, I will try to push the fact that everything is done with very simple methods, clear and readable (still available on <a href="https://github.com/banana-slugs-2014/GlucoseAmigo">github</a>).</p>

<p>When you work with a team on a very tight schedule (= all the time) you have to have concise code. You will never go back and edit/refactor the part you did not have time to write correctly today, and if you think otherwise, you are wrong!</p>

<h2>Giving thanks</h2>

<p>I always had the feeling that people don&rsquo;t get the praises they deserve.</p>

<p>Everywhere you go, no matter what you do, people will see the bad sides. If they see the good parts, then they will just not give it enough importance to praise as much as they would complain if they were bad&hellip;</p>

<p>When I got accepted for DBC, I thought I needed to work on it, in my own tiny world. After all, one of the idioms I try and follow is &ldquo;Be the change you want to see in the world&rdquo; &ndash; Gandhi.</p>

<p>So, back in France, I ended up finding old teacher that taught me how to do some things that people called useless, just to tell them how useful they were to me. I went to talk to everybody about what they were doing good&hellip;</p>

<p>I like to think that if I am in a very good place, I have the power to have a word that matters to most. If I don&rsquo;t use it, I am doing something wrong.</p>

<p>So today, I went to Steven, one of our teachers, to tell him about how inspiring he is to me. My words were, more or less : &ldquo;Before I came here, I ended up doubting myself, thinking that I was taking the wrong path, that I should not be all that &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; and start getting into the norm. But coming here, I realized a lot of people are like me. And I feel like he tends to be crazy a bit like I could be, and thanks to that, no matter where I go after that, I will forever know that there are people just like me, in a place somewhere, that they are doing great, and inspiring billions of people. So thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then ended up speaking with Shereef, the creator of Dev Bootcamp, and having more or less the same words. Also, I had a meeting with Sefora, a DBC staff member that works for the mental well being of the boots, and was very grateful that I met her. I am looking forward to having more conversations with all of these awesome people&hellip; I have so much to learn!</p>

<h2>D-4</h2>

<p>Today was the day we talk and meet people. In that same idea, I found out that I may end up introducing Thuy to new people everyday of her stay in here.</p>

<p>Teachers and DBC staff are on the list, alumni too, and then even current boots!</p>

<p>I know that there are some nice places and events that happen usually the first week of the month in SF apparently (I just discovered that), and so I will probably end up in all these things, with all these people.</p>

<p>I can say without much doubt that it will be an awesome week and I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The Glucose Amigos</h2>

<p>What an awesome name, that our captain found us! And here is the site : <a href="http://glucose-amigo.herokuapp.com">Glucose Amigo</a></p>

<p>So, we pretty much finished the app. This, guys, is what we can do in one week, with 4-5 of us, after 9 weeks of hard work. We came all with different experiences, behaviors, point of views, and in the end&hellip; We build a full app in one week.</p>

<p>I wish I would have more time to spend on the testing (I did most of the Javascript, there are 2 test, one on the login one on the logout&hellip;), but after that week of working with that awesome team, what I want to say is : Thank you DBC, thank you team, and thank you captain!</p>

<p>Working with all these awesome people is incredible!</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the app (and not read the &ldquo;help&rdquo; in the menu), the idea is that we made an app that keeps track of one or multiple diabetics&rsquo;s blood sugar level and weight, gives you a graph and a list of records, sends it per mail to your doctor, and can remind you to measure, and log the measures.</p>

<h2>Personalities</h2>

<p>In these 9 weeks, I saw a lot of different personalities. For example, among the people I paired with, I found 2 different types of people:</p>

<ul>
<li>People who want everything to be done, at the cost of understanding everything, but will not hesitate in going back at it to learn more about what they did not understood the first time</li>
<li>People who take the time to discover and learn everything even if it ends up taking them more than twice the time everybody else takes.</li>
</ul>


<p>I paired with both, and &hellip; strangely enough, no conflict emerged from it! I think I am a bit more of the second, but in the days I was working with somebody from the other group, I would just work his/her way, or use my &ldquo;reputation&rdquo; to try and teach the other person, go over what I did not see fully before, and go deeper.</p>

<p>In the end, I think I got most of what I could get from DBC, and mostly, I got the one lesson everybody should take : You don&rsquo;t know anything. Thinking you do is dangerous, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>Some people may think that this is just a fancy way to say that when you actually know what you&rsquo;re talking about (For real, I have already been told), but honestly, it is 100% of the truth. The difference between a confident person and and a stressed out one is quite often the fact that the confident already knows he has no idea what he&rsquo;s doing, but knows how to figure things out, learn, and maybe next time not have to spend too much time on it.</p>

<p>Also, we had to work on a personality test for our career week at DBC. My results&hellip; : <a href="http://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">You are an ENTJ</a>.</p>

<p>If I have to sum it up, I would say I am a confident and convincing leader who need people to survive and who sometimes end up relying too much on emotions. I don&rsquo;t know if it is true, but I like the description, so that&rsquo;s a start!</p>

<h2>D-5</h2>

<p>So, 5 days huh&hellip;</p>

<p>I learn a lot of new things around, about SF, about the city and everything around it, just to make sure I can be the perfect guide for Thuy. I have found cookies places that will blow her mind, and I think I found some great example of SF food that would make her love the place.</p>

<p>In the time I&rsquo;ve been here, I have not had any time to discover anything, but even in that small 10 blocks area that I lived in, I still found restaurants that have nothing to do with what we have in Paris, kinds of food we never ate, and better versions of things we found elsewhere (Of course, I did not find better bread, but that is another topic&hellip;)</p>

<p>I could say I have not seen the sea, Alcatraz, the bridges, or many other things, but the thing that I feel like I want to discover the most is &hellip; SF food and drinks! Maybe that is her influence, who knows&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, in the end, I just want to say thank you to SF in a whole. Your food rocks so hard I became addicted and I can&rsquo;t wait to get her hooked on that too ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all, I&rsquo;ll start by saying I am sorry I did not write before. I have been&hellip;overwhelmed by a few things I will try to sum up in this article, and just ended up having no time anyway.</p>

<h2>Ajax Everything</h2>

<p>So, our app is going great! You can see its evolution on : <a href="https://github.com/banana-slugs-2014/GlucoseAmigo">Github</a>. In all that, one of the biggest thing I played with on this app is the javascript. If you look in /app/assets/javascripts, you&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

<p>The idea is that we ended up developing everything separately (doctors, diabetics, records, etc&hellip;) and I ended up in charge of connecting it altogether in Javascript. To do so, I play with two types of routes in the app :</p>

<p>1 &ndash; Routes that render JSON :
Basically, I render a JSON object with 3 parameters :</p>

<ul>
<li>ok :  true or false, tells the javascript if the operation succeeded or not</li>
<li>path : The address of the next page</li>
<li>alert : The eventual problems or info messages.</li>
</ul>


<p>2 &ndash; Routes that render partials :
These render a small baby-html page with some javascript code to populate the javascript templates when it loads.</p>

<p>The idea is that every action and button is plugged on an action on the controller that calls a route that render JSON. If it returns ok:true, then I take the path, ask for the partial from it in javascript, and render it in the middle of the page, populating javascript templates on the go. If not, I print the alerts for 5 seconds and don&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>I had fun doing that and even though it needs a lot of refactoring right now, I hope you can see that and enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it.</p>

<h2>Pressure</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you get stuck in a strange loop. I just &hellip; had that exact thing.</p>

<p>I put a lot of pressure on me, to make sure I can make my way out of the life I had in France. Because of that, I end up sleeping less. But then if I sleep less, I think about that more, and sleep even less&hellip; * infinite loop *.</p>

<p>At some point, it breaks, and so it did. I ended up completely exhausted last thursday/friday, with a lot of things on my mind. I have to impress people to make sure I can move. But then I also know that I fought my way through to Dev Bootcamp, I worked hard IN Dev Bootcamp, I WILL make it happen no matter what. But it was not that clear at that time.</p>

<p>I gave this analogy to the people who ended up listening :<br/>
Picture a black NBA player that comes from a bad neighborhood.
He struggled to get food when he was a kid. He struggled against racism his whole life. He fought the system in school, every step of the way.<br/>
Now, he is fighting to get in the playoff and to be the MVP of every match he plays.</p>

<p>Well, if today, you were to tell him to go back to struggling to get food, he would be disappointed, probably angry, but he made it once and you can be sure he&rsquo;ll make it twice.</p>

<p>This is the kind of idea I have about going back to France. I don&rsquo;t mind struggling to find a better job, to make the world a better place, to make the difference against much more intelligent people. But what I would not like would be to have to go back to struggling for minimum wages with a 2 hours commute every morning every evening, and only 6 hours of seeing my fiance every week. I fought my way through, and I would rather not get back to that.<br/>
But then if I have to&hellip; I will.</p>

<p>The only thing I know now, is that I am a new person, and you can be sure that I will fight as much as I can to get my fiance, my sister, and the people I loved to the comfortable places that they deserve, and the world a better place, one step at a time.</p>

<h2>D-6</h2>

<p>She&rsquo;s coming!!!</p>

<p><strong>She&rsquo;s coming!!!</strong></p>

<p>My fiance, Thuy, the wonderful woman that actually chose to stick with me for 6 years now (I know, people are crazy&hellip;) is coming to San Francisco! I finally have the chance to get her into that world, show her what&rsquo;s happening, introduce her to the wonderful people I met&hellip;</p>

<p>And make her taste the great foods I found!</p>

<p>She still thinks that in the 7 days she get in here, she will end up getting a burger at burger king&hellip; Come on, people from here, let&rsquo;s laugh about it together ;)</p>

<p>She will be coming on next tuesday and I don&rsquo;t know how much I will be blogging at that point, but right now&hellip; It&rsquo;s D-6!</p>

<h2>An end before a new beginning</h2>

<p>Dev Bootcamp is coming to an end!</p>

<p>We are on our way to finish our last projects, we had fun, learned a lot, and met really cool people (looking at you, Chris! Haha). But this is now coming to an end.</p>

<p>However, I don&rsquo;t take it as an end but more like a beginning. I am a new self. I am a new this (got this, fellow developers?). I am a new person that now has the rest of his life to profit from this extraordinary experience.</p>

<p>I see that as the beginning of a new life that I will start, happily, with my fiance, or wife, we&rsquo;ll not stay like that for too long I hope. Not completely unlinked from the old life, but as a continuity, I see the before-graduation period as a preparatory stage for what is coming.</p>

<p>Now, things are different, it is a new life, and I intend to be very good at it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Group Project</h2>

<p>The big even of yesterday was: The final projects pitching.</p>

<p>Almost everybody pitched. You had good projects, strange projects, fun projects, good things!</p>

<p>The one I pitched was about Role Playing Games. The idea is that I really enjoy pen and paper role playing games, but I also can&rsquo;t play them most of the time. My friends are all around the world, and I don&rsquo;t spend my time with my character sheets, dice, and/or books in my pocket.</p>

<p>So to counter that, I wanted to make an app that makes the link between players and game masters, and give you these commands that will give you all the infos you have in these books, all the character sheets, and the dice rolling, just by sending a mail with different commands.</p>

<p>In the end, I was not picked as one of the projects we would work on, but then among the 5 projects, 3 were projects that I really want to work on!</p>

<p>So in the end, I am in Armando&rsquo;s team, and we are about to make a great app for diabetics to track their blood sugar stats and format them decently to transmit them to a doctor. I find it awesome and in a way, I am glad I was not picked!</p>

<h2>More pressure</h2>

<p>I put a lot of pressure on myself. Most of the time, I will not seem very stressed out, but inside, I may just be completely freaking out.</p>

<p>The idea is that I overthink everything. Being logical enough, I overthink without putting too much emotions and feeling in these thoughts. I see something, try to find all the outcomes (I will never succeed, but well&hellip;), try to think about the causes and consequences, study everybody&rsquo;s point of view&hellip;</p>

<p>In the end, I like to think that it makes me calm and not stress out much on the outside.</p>

<p>Lately, the fact that I am coming to a situation that had a bad outcome the last time(the same situation I came to when I came back from korea), made me think about a lot of things, basically ways to prevent myself from falling in the same trap again. That just made me sleep less&hellip; which actually made me think more&hellip; And I fell into this strange loop that ended with me being exhausted, and giving too much credit to emotions and feelings.</p>

<h2>Sleep depravation</h2>

<p>The lack of sleep I am talking about is mainly due to a non restful sleep. A sleep where you keep on waking up, thinking about bad things, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>This lack of sleep makes you take bad paths, the wrong paths, basically. In the end, I am now sleep depraved, and even though I worked on that pressure, and talking about it was enough to relieve a lot of pain on that topic, sleeping 6h does not make you really rested, especially if you&rsquo;ve been running on 5s for weeks&hellip;</p>

<p>But then, I am a logical person. I am also a person who does fall deep into these pressure cycles, but overcomes that. I did that before, a lot of time, and approaching things logically just ends up making me overcome whatever emotional challenge I have had so far.</p>

<p>So I work on my sleep, on my well being, and I am now much better than yesterday. Soon, I will be even better, and be sure that at the same time next week, our team will be kicking asses, and I will not be dragging them down!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Clean Javascript</h2>

<p>I will never say that enough, but if you code in Javascript and don&rsquo;t make it object oriented, you&rsquo;re missing something.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I paired with Johnny on a full frontend page. The idea is that we had a rails server with built-in routes, and we had to make the whole Javascript app that did everything with these routes, all in one page</p>

<p>In the end, we built a huge machine, all in Javascript, pure javascript (We did use some JQuery here and there, but the rest was all in javascript). That was fun, we played a lot, and we still finished what was expected of us for the whole day at 3PM.</p>

<p>In the end, we both learned a lot, had a lot of fun, and made a huge thing.</p>

<p>And the Javascript was&hellip; CLEAN! Object oriented, module pattern, fun stuff! No soup, no 100+ lines scripts&hellip;</p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>

<p>Tomorrow is the pitching day. I can feel the pressure, even though I do love it.</p>

<p>The idea is that we pitch an idea to the whole bootcamp. Then, people from our cohort vote for projects, and the teachers select 4 or 5 and we have to work on that until the very day.<br/>
The person who pitched the project will lead his/her 4-5 people group through that.</p>

<p>I am expecting a lot from that. I always loved to lead group (If you asked me when I was a kid I would have said that when I grow up, I want to be &hellip; a boss. The guy who make it so that things actually work, and that the whole team make it happen). Now, tomorrow is my chance to do that WITH code.</p>

<p>Plus, I have that strange feeling that tells me I don&rsquo;t have to show people some code, I have to IMPRESS people. Working on that group project, on one of my ideas, leading a group the right way, and coding my way through that, I think I can make that happen.</p>

<p>I will tell you more about it when that is over but&hellip; I feel like things are going to get crazy pretty fast&hellip; I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>

<h2>Leadership</h2>

<p>Leadership is something I like. It is something I always liked. Apparently, lastly, people like my leadership too, which gives me more opportunity to train that!</p>

<p>In the end, I always worked on that, always loved that, and not because I am a power hungry bearded dude, but because I want things to go well. When I am in a team, I love to be able to guide any part of the project in the right direction, to ensure a great realization. But then, there are things you can&rsquo;t change. Most of the time, you can&rsquo;t change the leader for instance. And if things are not working correctly, I would say it is his/her responsibility! So to fight that, I always wanted to lead, and be able to change whatever needed to be changed, even myself.</p>

<p>Today, I had a fun conversation with David of Phase 1 and Stephen. The topic was : Games and Leadership.</p>

<p>I loved to have feedback on the feeling I give to people around, to hear about the ideas David and Stephen had, and to share everybody&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>These people are just &hellip; AWESOME!</p>

<p>I will tell you more about it whenever I can but for now&hellip; It&rsquo;s time to sleep for a good pitching day!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>JQuery</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I paired with Ivan. I like the fact that even if he had not been fully recommended for phase 2, he kicks ass in phase 3!</p>

<p>We build a new version of JQuery, just to make sure we understood things, we got in the mind of libraries makers, and we broke the idea of &ldquo;this is magic&rdquo; that everybody has. The idea is to not be a consumer of music, but more of an audiophile, or even a sound engineer if that is what we are looking for (Said by <a href="https://twitter.com/sgharms">Steven</a>).</p>

<p>And so we worked on that, made the whole part of the library we had to, with clean and tricky javascript.</p>

<p>In the end, I had a very good coding day. At 6, we had finished the program, understood what we had to take from it, and had a clean refactored code. All in all, I can say we rocked ;)</p>

<h2>Superego</h2>

<p>Yesterday was also the new day where phase 1 learn about their superego. Just like every time a phase get in one, we get to witness that change in some mentalities, that feeling that make people talk more, share more of their experiences, knowing that things happened the same way for all of us.</p>

<p>In the end, some, mostly outspoken people, reacted with the experience being easy on them. When you don&rsquo;t hesitate in sharing and talking, sharing about your superego should not affect you that much, right?</p>

<p>Some others were more affected and ended up sharing more (Go David!).</p>

<p>Most of them though had already one week before that hard session. So in the end, it was &ldquo;less&rdquo; heavy on them.</p>

<p>But since that made people share a bit more, I love it ^.^</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>I have a tremendous amount of cookies in my locker.</p>

<p>Coming here, I started eating a lot of cookies. I went to good bakeries, found ways to get more, etc.. to the point that nowadays, I am called &ldquo;Cookie Monster&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I went and get some at Subway. When it&rsquo;s 10€ for 12 in your country, but 5$ for 12 here&hellip; you don&rsquo;t hesitate much, do you?<br/>
But then I also got some cookies from &ldquo;Batter&rdquo;, a very good bakery down the street apparently.</p>

<p>So in my locker I have close to 30 huge cookies just waiting for me.</p>

<p>Then, a funny thing happened. 2 days ago, I paired with Chris. We finished in a decent amount of time, and while he was &ldquo;expected&rdquo; to get home around 10PM, he actually came home around 7.</p>

<p>So his girlfriend ended up saying:  &ldquo;How come?&#8221;<br/>
And the answer she got was apparently : &#8220;Quentin&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>After that, she just suggested she would bake cookies to thank me&hellip;</p>

<p>So&hellip; I am getting more cookies! Thuy is gonna be so proud ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Making pages fast</h2>

<p>Yesterday, we had a fun day about optimisation. The idea is that we had pages that were loading in 20 seconds or more, and we had to find ways to fasten them.</p>

<p>What we got from that is, among others :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use SQL requests to order, group, etc&hellip;  It is MUCH faster than getting everything from the database and sorting it in ruby or JS</li>
<li>JS allows you to act as if you loaded everything even if you did not, USE THAT. Play with ajax, load only the titles, and when somebody clicks on a button, you load the rest!</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end, all the pages were loading under 200 ms. Next part is destroying these pages to make useful ones instead haha.</p>

<h2>Group projects</h2>

<p>We just finished the weekend group project with Armando, Hunter, Chermaine, and Matthew. It was really a bread group, a great dynamic. We were very laid back, no stress or anything. We did finish what we wanted and even more, everything works, and we had clear, maintainable, and tested code.</p>

<p>Now with that being said, we have the final group projects coming on Thursday. People have been talking about it fo a bit now, sharing ideas that people are gonna pitch, checking them out&hellip;</p>

<p>I know I have a few ideas on my own, and I am interested in pitching them and then leading a group with that. I will not talk about them now, especially since they&rsquo;re not that clear in my mind even now, but don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; It&rsquo;s coming ;)</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I ate with fiery skippers. I find it really amazing that people are so different from the cohorts we could see so far. They are a huge group of very knowledge hungry people.</p>

<p>During the weekend, I also spent a lot of time with them, trying to push them in the right direction to solve Sudoku, the challenge people complete in the first week.</p>

<p>I also spent a bit of time with phase 2 Golden Bears, trying to share what I know.</p>

<p>And yesterday, I spent an hour with Armando showing him a way to complete some Javascript exercise without feeling lost about being in a language he is not used to.
In the end, I just showed him how to solve the problem in Ruby, a language he feels more comfortable in, and how to translate it to Javascript.</p>

<p>I loved teaching in Korea, and before that. I like to share my knowledge (which, if you follow the famous french saying, means that I have very little knowledge myself). And now I see that even here, I love doing that.</p>

<p>I love trying to explain things to people actually listening, and using what you are showing them.</p>

<p>I think that after DBC, I will try to be a coach. I think I can be a decent help, and have a lot of fun doing it!</p>

<p>Anyway, that is for in 2 weeks, which in DBC time means something like 2 or 3 months ^.^</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, yesterday was a nice day. I wish I had a lot to say about it, but the idea is that I rested, I pair with the awesome Matthew, I ate well, I finished what I wanted, no pressure, nice weather, everything.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sad that I don&rsquo;t have much to say about it, but that&rsquo;s cool ^.^</p>

<p>See you guys on monday!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Todos</h2>

<p>So, in DBC, we made Todos. When I say that, I mean, we learned how to make a todo app jn Ruby, with the command line. Then we learned how to make a new one that saves and read things in a file. After that we got in phase 2 and made a simple Sinatra Todo app. Then we made one that used Javascript, and now we&rsquo;re 4 days into phase 3, and we already made 2 todo apps.</p>

<p>I feel like there is a common theme somewhere&hellip; Are DBC teachers trying to tell us something?</p>

<p>I do not tend to use todo apps myself nowadays but I now know how to make it however I want. I also know how to manage my time, or&hellip;  know how to not manage my time actually.</p>

<p>As for code, I know that using that same theme to learn new things help a lot, and I feel like I can learn what I want to learn by simply making a todo with it and comparing with what I know.</p>

<p>And since I intend to learn much more&hellip; I end up with many todos apps eon my todo list&hellip;</p>

<h2>Group Project</h2>

<p>We got a small group project again, in Rails. Things are much easier, Rails does everything, people are confident, and we can now play with these interesting things, at our own pace, without stressing out!</p>

<p>This week we have to make a &ldquo;Stack Overflow&rdquo;-like app. Basically, answer questions, select the best answer, and comment questions or answers. Also, they can vote for a question or an answer, and the site makes the selection after that.</p>

<p>I am not even sure what to say about that, but it is what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re having fun, and have an awesome group again, I guess I&rsquo;ll have something to show on monday, but even if I don&rsquo;t&hellip; No biggie!</p>

<h2>Effects of DBC</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I did something that triggered <a href="http://mknudsen01.tumblr.com">Matthew</a>. Basically, without getting too deep into that, I made him feel like he was left out for a moment, search for a reason why I would do so, and end up on some pretty bad, sad, and mean reasons.</p>

<p>But then, magic happened.</p>

<p>When I came back to work with him, before we started, we had a conversation that kinda went like this :</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we start, do you mind if we talk for a second?<br/>
&ndash; Yeah sure, no problem, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, he ended up sharing what exactly happened, what he felt, what he saw, and what he feels now. I shared how I felt about it, explained and confirmed what he saw, and apologized. And that was an argument that was solved in less than 2 minutes, without any fight or hard  feeling.</p>

<p>This is what DBC made. DBC made us understanding human beings. DBC made Matthew not freak out about what happened, try to check what was happening, and then reflect. DBC made me listen, put myself in his shoes and be understanding.</p>

<p>I had an experience like that with my fiancee, and it is quite strange to realize that what you have been learning, no matter how true it was in your current environment, is actually true outside of it.</p>

<p>The first time I started listening like we try to do it here, it actually worked flawlessly. I tried again, it worked again. It may not work 100% of the time, but I know that I will keep on doing that for a while!</p>
