  <p>I created this blog as a part of the Dev Bootcamp, mostly. But what is it? How does it work?<br/>
Time to give you guys a bit more info, at least about what I know so far&hellip;<!-- more --></p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>My words will probably be much more wrong that these :&nbsp;<a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-more/"><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-more/">http://devbootcamp.com/learn-more/</a></a>&nbsp;.<br/>
But to put it simply :&nbsp;<br/>
Dev Bootcamp is an intensive program that aims to teach you how to become a good developper in 9 weeks (Plus 12 weeks, less intensive, to train beforehand, and a few more afterwhile).<br/>
!You don&rsquo;t need to have mad coding skills to enter, any experience. What you need is genuine interest, and being able to show that you can learn.</p>

<h2>Can I join then, and how?</h2>

<p>Well, as I was saying, it is not a program for hardcore coders, it is one for genuinely interested people who can learn.<br/>
So if you think this description would fit you : Apply!<br/>
The selection is in 3 steps.<br/>
1 : You answer the questions they have in an online application.<br/>
2 : You make a 5 minutes video that tells the viewer a bit more about you, and teaches something you know to that same person.<br/>
3 : If your video and application are selected, you get an interview with one of the Bootcamp&rsquo;s recruiters.<br/>
Now, remember, what they want to see is : Are you genuinely interested? Are you able to learn? And how interesting are you?<br/>
If you can show them that you fit the description, then you will just have to choose a place and date and here you go!</p>

<h2>So how does it work once you&rsquo;re in?</h2>

<p>Well, you got in, now you have to pay to book your spot. Cohorts (= Promotions) are small, and they intend to make it stay this way. So the fastest you can pay the first deposit, the better the chances to have the spot you&#8217;ld want, and so the better it is for everybody<br/>
Now, the bootcamp in itself will start 12 weeks before the &ldquo;Starting day&rdquo; you booked. Before that, Try to check out everything they put in the list for new recruits. There are tutorials, books, many things. Not doing them all will not make you fail, but it will most likely make it a bit harder than if you had.<br/>
Also, try to get in contact with people from your group. Dev Bootcamp will teach you how to be a developper, and so how to work with other developpers. There will be a lot of group projects, pair-programming (you&rsquo;ll know about that soon enough hehe), and so the fastest you get together and start organizing, the better it will be for you.<br/>
You will also, most likely, need to find a place near the bootcamp, and plan a lot of stuff for when it all starts, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to plan in advance (and all together, which will make you save a lot of money on your new place and stuff like that). You will most likely not get a solid plan for everything 9 months in advance, but looking around does not hurt.<br/>
Soon enough, you&rsquo;ll be at the D-12 weeks milestone : Phase 0 starts</p>

<h2>Dev Bootcamp &ndash; Phase 0</h2>

<p>As I mentionned in an earlier post, Dev Bootcamp is not about making you able to code stuff, or giving you a coding job, but about making you a developper.<br/>
To follow that idea, the first &ldquo;Lesson&rdquo; you get in the first day of the first week of phase 0 is about Developper&rsquo;s Empathy. The idea is that you have feelings, and are encouraged to have even more and stronger ones, but you should be able to manage them.<u>Wherever you code, you will have to work in team and more importantly work WITH this team.</u><br/>
One could ask &ldquo;What if I want to code an app alone?&#8221;<br/>
This could be thought as being in no team, but the idea is that you still have a team. This team is a group that contains the present you, the past you, and the future you. Past you built some code, and now present you is trying to adapt and refactor that code to add new features, while thinking and modeling it so that future you don&rsquo;t look at the code and die of an instant brain disease.<br/>
So, with that in mind, Phase 0 starts with a few code challenges per week, increasingly hard of course, to do with other people from your group. Add a weekly meeting with instructors to make sure you&rsquo;re doing ok, with the code AND with the others, and you will have around 15 hours per week of DBC-ing.<br/>
I would tell you more about all that, but that&rsquo;s where I am right now so I&rsquo;ll stop here for now. After all, the post name is &#8220;Welcome to Dev Bootcamp&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Everything about Dev Bootcamp&rdquo;. <br/>
Don&rsquo;t hesitate if you have any questions, and I hope I&rsquo;ll have helped you in some way with this post!<br/>
See you sooon for more on the bootcamp!</p>
