<div class="entry-content"><h2>Building</h2>

<p>So, yesterday&rsquo;s challenges were : Build apps. In the morning, we had to finish the Craigslist one that we started the day before, and in the afternoon, we had to make a non-authenticated blog.</p>

<p>The teachers have to change a lot from last phase 2 program. We are different, and our phase 1 was so different than previous cohorts&#8217; than in the end, we don&rsquo;t code like our big brothers and sisters at all. While some of the previous cohorts (Thanks to their program/material ) tended to focus a lot on speed, and quantity, we tend to spend a ton of time on specific challenges, to master them to the end. While some would probably go for the &ldquo;Quantity of knowledge&rdquo;, we are going for &ldquo;Mastery&rdquo;. So in the end, while previous cohorts finished 10 challenges by the end of day 3, we finished only 4 but we did learn just as much and mastered a lot of things that previous people did not know about. An example would be Rspec testing. We literally spent all of yesterday testing&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, at the end we finished one app, with Johnny : <a href="http://quentin-johnny-anon-blog.herokuapp.com/">Anonymous Blog</a>. It is not beautiful, not responsive, nothing like that, but the idea was not to make beautiful things, but to make a functional blog system that allows you to have posts that can have tags, and tags that can have many posts, with the corresponding pages.</p>

<p>We are about to finish Craigslist so I&rsquo;ll show you that right after.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>We tested! For 2 days!</p>

<p>In the beginning, we just started to assert that things we wanted were equal. If we call &ldquo;5 + 5&rdquo;, we ask for it to be equal. That was phase 1.</p>

<p>Then we started playing with some more tests, witnessing teachers/talking about re making Rspec (The testing suite for testing in ruby. Think about it as a toolbox with a LOT of tools).</p>

<p>Now in Phase 2, we have Rspec, we have other tools, and we need that. The syntax is easy, very close to english. For example :</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">expect(5+5).to be 10</code></pre>


<p>And so the hardest part was : figuring out how ENGLISH it was. Is it &ldquo;.to&rdquo;? Is it &ldquo; to&rdquo;? Do I want to test if &ldquo;5+5 =10&rdquo; is true? or if &ldquo;5+5&rdquo; is 10?</p>

<p>That, guys, is what we spent two days working on. We figured out a lot (and for future reference for students : <a href="http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax">You should not use should! but expect is cool</a> and <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers/master/frames">Shoulda is your best friend if you&rsquo;re testing Sinatra or Rails&hellip; Anything with ActiveRecord, even if it needs should and not expect</a>), but it did take a lot of time.</p>

<p>Now, I feel like I know much more about things like one a quote from one of my favorite books : “You don&rsquo;t have to test everything to destruction just to see if you made it right.”, Neil Gaiman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Omens-Accurate-Prophecies-Nutter/dp/0060853980/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392918350&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=good+omens">Good Omens</a>. Testing is good, but can be time devouring if not done right.</p>

<p>But anyway, let&rsquo;s not talk about that more, there is always much to write and read about that, but there are places and times to do so!</p>

<h2>Deception</h2>

<p>Yesterday I was disappointed by <a href="http://www.interflora.fr/">Interflora</a>. If you don&rsquo;t know that brand, it&rsquo;s a flower selling service that is offered in France. It is a chain, you hear a lot about it, and so I thought I would use it when I needed that kind of service.</p>

<p>Yesterday was my fiancee and I&rsquo;s <strong>6th anniversary</strong>. I can&rsquo;t be with her (Obviously&hellip;), so instead, I planned on making the biggest bouquet I could find delivered at her house when she would be coming home on this day. That was a long time plan, I kept the exact money I needed on my french bank account, I did some research to find how to get flowers delivered, and talked to a lot of people about that to never ever forget.</p>

<p>Then, a few days ago when I got the confirmation that I had the money I needed to do so (last week), I took the biggest chain I could find, for safety, I took the biggest bouquet I could find, and make it delivered at 4PM at her house, right after she comes back home from work.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when she woke up, I did not even send her a text. She was, of course, disappointed, but I was planning on that (and am very bad with time differences sometimes)! She thought I had forgotten that fateful day! But then she would be so happy when she would get back home from a long and hard day and find these flowers!</p>

<p>But then&hellip; No flower was delivered. None. I checked the time, checked in with her to see if she had them, check the site to be sure they were delivered, and the site even told me &ldquo;The flower delivery guy has the order&rdquo;, which eventually turned to &ldquo;Your flowers have been delivered&rdquo;&hellip; But none got to her house. So I had to explain everything, my plan fell apart, and today she called them to check about the order and&hellip; Guess what? &hellip; Apparently the girl on the phone told her the delivery guy never got the order.</p>

<p>So in short : I planned, I payed, went for safety over better shops, and in the end I feel just like an ass that did not do anything for our 6th anniversary, but just a couple of texts saying that I love and miss her.</p>

<p>I am so sorry, Thuy, I am very unhappy about that, and I will never stress that enough: <strong>I WILL NEVER USE INTERFLORA AGAIN IN MY LIFE</strong></p>

<p>Time to go back to coding now, see you tomorrow ;)</p>
