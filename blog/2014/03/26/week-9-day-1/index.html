<div class="entry-content"><p>First of all, I&rsquo;ll start by saying I am sorry I did not write before. I have been&hellip;overwhelmed by a few things I will try to sum up in this article, and just ended up having no time anyway.</p>

<h2>Ajax Everything</h2>

<p>So, our app is going great! You can see its evolution on : <a href="https://github.com/banana-slugs-2014/GlucoseAmigo">Github</a>. In all that, one of the biggest thing I played with on this app is the javascript. If you look in /app/assets/javascripts, you&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

<p>The idea is that we ended up developing everything separately (doctors, diabetics, records, etc&hellip;) and I ended up in charge of connecting it altogether in Javascript. To do so, I play with two types of routes in the app :</p>

<p>1 &ndash; Routes that render JSON :
Basically, I render a JSON object with 3 parameters :</p>

<ul>
<li>ok :  true or false, tells the javascript if the operation succeeded or not</li>
<li>path : The address of the next page</li>
<li>alert : The eventual problems or info messages.</li>
</ul>


<p>2 &ndash; Routes that render partials :
These render a small baby-html page with some javascript code to populate the javascript templates when it loads.</p>

<p>The idea is that every action and button is plugged on an action on the controller that calls a route that render JSON. If it returns ok:true, then I take the path, ask for the partial from it in javascript, and render it in the middle of the page, populating javascript templates on the go. If not, I print the alerts for 5 seconds and don&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>I had fun doing that and even though it needs a lot of refactoring right now, I hope you can see that and enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it.</p>

<h2>Pressure</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you get stuck in a strange loop. I just &hellip; had that exact thing.</p>

<p>I put a lot of pressure on me, to make sure I can make my way out of the life I had in France. Because of that, I end up sleeping less. But then if I sleep less, I think about that more, and sleep even less&hellip; * infinite loop *.</p>

<p>At some point, it breaks, and so it did. I ended up completely exhausted last thursday/friday, with a lot of things on my mind. I have to impress people to make sure I can move. But then I also know that I fought my way through to Dev Bootcamp, I worked hard IN Dev Bootcamp, I WILL make it happen no matter what. But it was not that clear at that time.</p>

<p>I gave this analogy to the people who ended up listening :<br/>
Picture a black NBA player that comes from a bad neighborhood.
He struggled to get food when he was a kid. He struggled against racism his whole life. He fought the system in school, every step of the way.<br/>
Now, he is fighting to get in the playoff and to be the MVP of every match he plays.</p>

<p>Well, if today, you were to tell him to go back to struggling to get food, he would be disappointed, probably angry, but he made it once and you can be sure he&rsquo;ll make it twice.</p>

<p>This is the kind of idea I have about going back to France. I don&rsquo;t mind struggling to find a better job, to make the world a better place, to make the difference against much more intelligent people. But what I would not like would be to have to go back to struggling for minimum wages with a 2 hours commute every morning every evening, and only 6 hours of seeing my fiance every week. I fought my way through, and I would rather not get back to that.<br/>
But then if I have to&hellip; I will.</p>

<p>The only thing I know now, is that I am a new person, and you can be sure that I will fight as much as I can to get my fiance, my sister, and the people I loved to the comfortable places that they deserve, and the world a better place, one step at a time.</p>

<h2>D-6</h2>

<p>She&rsquo;s coming!!!</p>

<p><strong>She&rsquo;s coming!!!</strong></p>

<p>My fiance, Thuy, the wonderful woman that actually chose to stick with me for 6 years now (I know, people are crazy&hellip;) is coming to San Francisco! I finally have the chance to get her into that world, show her what&rsquo;s happening, introduce her to the wonderful people I met&hellip;</p>

<p>And make her taste the great foods I found!</p>

<p>She still thinks that in the 7 days she get in here, she will end up getting a burger at burger king&hellip; Come on, people from here, let&rsquo;s laugh about it together ;)</p>

<p>She will be coming on next tuesday and I don&rsquo;t know how much I will be blogging at that point, but right now&hellip; It&rsquo;s D-6!</p>

<h2>An end before a new beginning</h2>

<p>Dev Bootcamp is coming to an end!</p>

<p>We are on our way to finish our last projects, we had fun, learned a lot, and met really cool people (looking at you, Chris! Haha). But this is now coming to an end.</p>

<p>However, I don&rsquo;t take it as an end but more like a beginning. I am a new self. I am a new this (got this, fellow developers?). I am a new person that now has the rest of his life to profit from this extraordinary experience.</p>

<p>I see that as the beginning of a new life that I will start, happily, with my fiance, or wife, we&rsquo;ll not stay like that for too long I hope. Not completely unlinked from the old life, but as a continuity, I see the before-graduation period as a preparatory stage for what is coming.</p>

<p>Now, things are different, it is a new life, and I intend to be very good at it!</p>
