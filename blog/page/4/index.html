  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Cries</h2>

<p>So today we started Engineer Empathy courses. The idea of this course seems to be that the better you are with yourself and the better your ability to work with others, the better engineer you will become.<br/>
Now, just like everything else in this program, EE is freakingly intense.<br/>
Yesterday we had a session about the Superego and how to recognize attacks from it and defend.
That does not sound much but&hellip; I just ended up almost in tears thinking about strange attacks against myself. Sometimes we just don&rsquo;t really think about the things we put ourselves through, but then when these come back, that&rsquo;s when you have a bad time. Well, let me tell you that people who are crazy enough to join Dev Bootcamp have a lot of</p>

<p>Now if that was not intense enough, I had decided to run a bit too far 2 days ago and so now I just look like a 3rd age dude having a hard time walking all around. That brings some tears too haha.</p>

<h2>Laughter</h2>

<p>Today they gave us a pairing buddy for the whole day. Mine was &hellip; Matthew!<br/>
I spent most of the day enjoying what I was doing, at least for the fact that I was doing it with somebody I appreciate and really have fun with. We joked all around, and even though some may say that it is quite counterproductive, we finished the challenges right at the same time as others, and I got the feeling we learnt exactly enough!</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>So, today we spent the morning reviewing the code some used to complete the challenges of yesterday. We ended up comparing hashes + #each with no data + if (The if waterfall seems to be faster&hellip;), and all that with or without recursion. In the end, we can say that in this small exercise, recursion was a waste of time, and not maintainable, hashes + #each keeps the code organized so maintainable, but then the If waterfall was just horrible to watch but a bit more efficient&hellip; The world of code is a strange place, guys&hellip;</p>

<p>In the afternoon we worked on sorting algorithm. After a bit of time going crazy over explanations not explaining much and hurting our brains and souls, Rao, a coach with a nice and funny meow-like name gave us some more options and we found out how to do all that. We implemented the merge sorting algorithm and that did not take us much time from here. The funny surprise though was that at the end, we cleared the 3 170k words files in around 1.5 seconds each&hellip; While every other algorithm just took at least 10 minutes. Some even calculated that theirs could last for a day just sorting one of the files. Algorithms are crazy and are to be known!</p>

<p>Now, time to go back and code guys, see ya!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I won&rsquo;t go as far as to tell everything since the last post. Challenges went by, I continued pairing with Armando, working at my strange company that just ended up closing, and then the closer I got to my 8000 miles travel, the busier I got&hellip;</p>

<p>Plus, I just ended up taking all the time I could get to see my fiance.
And let me tell you guys : That was worth it, and a very good idea !</p>

<p>Then, 3 days ago I arrived in SF. I just had time to discover simple things here and there, get an account at the bank, a mobile line, and all the things you need for a simple life nowadays.</p>

<p>Now, up to the main topic :</p>

<h2>The program started</h2>

<p>So, yesterday, we were expected at Dev Bootcamp, just at the entrance of Chinatown, for 9AM. We met the last remaining people of the cohort that we had not met before, and waited there, anxiously waiting.
At 9AM sharp, shouts and claps started right behind that little door we had not passed yet&hellip;</p>

<p>They opened the doors, and things went wild.
I won&rsquo;t go as far as to explain everything in details, but for this first post in a while I&rsquo;ll just sum it up as :</p>

<ul>
<li>People are awesome. Teachers, Coaches, other students, other cohorts, everybody!</li>
<li>We should be expecting 60-80 hours weeks, and even there we probably won&rsquo;t get over everything anyway.</li>
<li>Sherif, one of our teachers, is really eloquent&hellip; You can hear pure knowledge come out of his mouth&hellip; That&rsquo;s insane</li>
<li>Sherif told us repeatedly : We are insane for thinking it is doable. But the common insanity is what bounds us and may end up making it possible.</li>
<li>We are guinea pigs. The program we will be living will be a bit different than the others, but then I&rsquo;ll explain that later.</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, I can say that we are joining a program that shows us how to work and let us do the job and find about what to do and how, assess our learning,&hellip;
We are basically the ones making it possible. Teachers guide us, but that is all.</p>

<p>Now, time to head up to DBC again, cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, DBC prep is well on (expect a bigger post about that some time soon of course), and this week, we got a challenge about refactoring a couple of classes and some calls to these classes about a Drawer and Silverware we&#8217;ld clean and put in it. And our goal here is to refactor and correct the errors we could find.<br/>
After talking with some boots from the cohort (DBC language, read &ldquo;colleagues&rdquo;), I found that people were getting stuck on the exact same part of this challenge, so I figured some may like having some explanation on what&rsquo;s up here. </div>
