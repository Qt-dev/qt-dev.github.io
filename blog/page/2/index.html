  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Games</h2>

<p>Yesterday was a day when we had to start and implement games. We went from a simple piglatin creator to a boggle board solver.<br/>
For this day, I had to pair with Eric. Eric is nice, and fun. But then I just navigated, pointed the pair to a place where the waters were much too deep, and we ended up just trying to figure some things that we&rsquo;re supposed to care about in a few weeks out. That was not pretty, we learned a lot but ended up not finishing the exercises when others did / we had to get to the next one.</p>

<p>No biggie though, we ended up just climbing back and finishing the exercises, or at least most of them, in due time.<br/>
I do feel sorry for pushing the pair into places we should not have been, and so maybe take time off or learning some valuable info that we should have at that point, but I hope I made it up by being extra precise and helpful if I could for the next part&hellip; I&rsquo;ll have to see that with Eric I guess! Feedback, here we are.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p>It was the day I got a few solutions.</p>

<p>First solution : We solved that f**king problem, Rao is really awesome!<br/>
Check the other blog posts if you want to know what I&rsquo;m talking about!</p>

<p>Other solutons : The exercises were not all very hard, they just needed to be taken the exact right way, or you&#8217;ld just get lost in deep non-understandable stuff that take too much time. We code from 8AM to 11PM, and have 9 books to read&hellip; All that by the end of the week. Let&rsquo;s just not take that path.</p>

<p>Anyway, I said I navigated, pushed the pair to a wrong place that just got us stuck. While doing that, I like to take small times off that coding, review what the others are doing, and try to help others. In my mind, finding the solution for somebody&rsquo;s challenges just makes me trigger some kind of chain events that take me to the point when I can solve mine.<br/>
So that&rsquo;s what I did. That did not really helped me work things out on the problems we were having, not at the end at least, but that helped me figure out exercises in advance by helping people that were on 2 while I was on 1.</p>

<p>And THAT helped a lot. In the end, when we got back to our exercise, we just have to recapitulate, check the things I told the others about, and if we agreed on that : Implement. Thanks to that, exercises that could have taken hours to solve just took a few minutes and nothing else!</p>

<p>Anyway, today is Sudoku day. Apparently we have to make a sudoku board creator, and a sudoku game solver&hellip; That&rsquo;s gonna be fun! See you after that!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The context</h2>

<p>So, I am in Dev Bootcamp. Yesterday, while trying to implement a customized class, I tried to make ruby respond to :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">myClass</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">]=</span><span class="s2">&quot;new_value&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>My buddy and I were trying to get used to Test-Driven Development (<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Driven_Development">If you want more info&hellip; Thanks Wikipedia!</a>). So I had a very simple test method that tested if 2 things were equal.<br/>
I was testing that this code would return true, just to make sure the whole code of my method was executed.</p>

<p>Come this test, we found out that it wanted a method called &ldquo;[]=&rdquo;, so we did. Our method looked something like :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">[]=</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">new_value</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">#Do some stuff</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>So, we got this method, this test, so far so good. Now, we launch the test to check if the result to that first expression is true and&hellip; No. The test said that this method just ended up returning the value that we were passing it (In this case &ldquo;new_value&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Maybe that method was not doing what it should, so we used the Debugger gem (<a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/debugger/1.6.5/frames">Docs</a>). With that we just checked step by step what it would be doing.<br/>
&ndash;  First : It is calling the method. The debugger throws us right there in the middle of the method.<br/>
&ndash;  Second : It is actually doing what we want. The data is changed, and it goes through the last line that returns true.<br/>
&ndash;  Third : It does not care about that because on the very next step, the trace you have of this method and what it returns already became &ldquo;new_value&rdquo;</p>

<p>We then asked more experienced boots, and came up with a test where we&#8217;ld be calling the method like this :<br/>
<code>ruby myClass.[]=(index,"new_value")</code>
Conclusion of this test : SUCCESS!<br/>
This calls the method without any problem, and that is done exactly how we want.</p>

<p>So at that point are conclusions were :<br/>
&ndash; The method is called<br/>
&ndash; The method does what it should, even the return<br/>
&ndash; Its behavior changes when we call it with ruby&rsquo;s &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo;, or syntaxic sugar (<a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_syntactic_sugar.html">More info</a>) and we end up having the return value disappearing, and the second argument becoming that return value.</p>

<h2>Assignments methods</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pause on that particular problem for a second to talk about assignment methods.</p>

<p>Assignment methods can be used to assign a value to a particular item, like the name says. But in Ruby, everything is object. So assignment methods are actually methods, simple ones defined just like an initialize. What differenciate them mostly is :<br/>
&ndash; An assignment method can has any number of spaces before its = when it is called.<br/>
&ndash; When you call it with the &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo;, the behavior will be neglected and replaced.</p>

<p>Now, the important thing&hellip; Let me rephrase that : The <blink>IMPORTANT</blink> thing is how ruby selects what is and what is not an assigment method.</p>

<p>The answer is : It takes the last character of the name of the method, and checks if it is an equal.<br/>
If it is, your method will be considered an assignment method.</p>

<p>If we take our problem, the method can clearly be detected as an assignment method. That means that it can be called with spaces between the brackets and the = sign, and even more because ruby has a special shortcut for the methods with such a name (The one we used).<br/>
That also means that the behavior will be transformed.</p>

<p>Well, do you want to guess what behavior is the principal one concerned by that statement? You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s the return. The rubydoc tells us that using an assignment method, so the shortcut we are talking about, will always return the argument.</p>

<p>So, our code did work. It did do what we wanted it to do. But unless we wanted to redefine primitive ruby behavior by diving in Ruby&rsquo;s source, there is no way we can make an assignment method return anything else than the thing on the right.</p>

<p>So, guys, be REALLY careful when you call your method with an =. That may help you in some parts, but it may also leave you and your friends, coworkers, teachers craving for answers ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Data Structures/types</h2>

<p>Yesterday was the optionnal solo day, the day when we choose if we pair or not and work on some challenges. The code of the day was about Data Structures. I wont go as far as to try and explain all of that in detail in this blogpost but the idea is that you have all these data types in languages.<br/>
For example, a String is a chain of characters. It has a length, characters at specified index, and methods to compare Strings together, to change some character, and all the other operations you would want to do on such an object.<br/>
Once you get that far, it is what you call Abstract Data Structure. Then you implement it into a Data type, or a Data structure, according to if this ADT is a chain of separable elements, or an element in itself.</p>

<p>So, in short, we spent most of the day working to understand that 100%<br/>
And if you are curious about if I chose to work alone, I did not. I chose to work with the &ldquo;Brother from another mother&rdquo;, Armando.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>In our lunch talks, Shadi introduced us to Test-driven development. The idea is that when you have an idea about what you want to do, and no matter how strong the feeling that you can code that is, you will just write tests to verify all that first.<br/>
Your algorithm will not work (Duh&hellip; You did not write any code yet), but you then just launch your script, and jump from error to error, deciphering and correcting them on the way, one by one, never thinking about the big picture. Then when you finish that, you check if the code does exactly what you want. If not, you write more specific tests.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular beliefs, people are really bad at multitasking, and so doing that allows you to complete simple tasks one by one, without multitasking, and empowering your debugging skills on the way.</p>

<p>So, Test driven development, I love you. (Not as much as my fiance of course, but we&rsquo;re getting close)</p>

<h2>A brain teaser</h2>

<p>So, we worked on data structures, while using test-driven-development. While doing that we ended up redefining a method whose syntax is recognized and transformed by ruby&rsquo;s Syntaxic sugar :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">[]=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which transforms into :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">thing</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So far so good.<br/>
Now, the problem we find is that in Ruby, even if you make that method return something, the second expression, the after-SS one, is returning 4.<br/>
I will tell you more when I realize what happens and why, but let&rsquo;s say other cohorts did not know, coaches did not know, Sherif did not know, and we have to know&hellip; So let&rsquo;s hunt for that!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Cries</h2>

<p>So today we started Engineer Empathy courses. The idea of this course seems to be that the better you are with yourself and the better your ability to work with others, the better engineer you will become.<br/>
Now, just like everything else in this program, EE is freakingly intense.<br/>
Yesterday we had a session about the Superego and how to recognize attacks from it and defend.
That does not sound much but&hellip; I just ended up almost in tears thinking about strange attacks against myself. Sometimes we just don&rsquo;t really think about the things we put ourselves through, but then when these come back, that&rsquo;s when you have a bad time. Well, let me tell you that people who are crazy enough to join Dev Bootcamp have a lot of</p>

<p>Now if that was not intense enough, I had decided to run a bit too far 2 days ago and so now I just look like a 3rd age dude having a hard time walking all around. That brings some tears too haha.</p>

<h2>Laughter</h2>

<p>Today they gave us a pairing buddy for the whole day. Mine was &hellip; Matthew!<br/>
I spent most of the day enjoying what I was doing, at least for the fact that I was doing it with somebody I appreciate and really have fun with. We joked all around, and even though some may say that it is quite counterproductive, we finished the challenges right at the same time as others, and I got the feeling we learnt exactly enough!</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>So, today we spent the morning reviewing the code some used to complete the challenges of yesterday. We ended up comparing hashes + #each with no data + if (The if waterfall seems to be faster&hellip;), and all that with or without recursion. In the end, we can say that in this small exercise, recursion was a waste of time, and not maintainable, hashes + #each keeps the code organized so maintainable, but then the If waterfall was just horrible to watch but a bit more efficient&hellip; The world of code is a strange place, guys&hellip;</p>

<p>In the afternoon we worked on sorting algorithm. After a bit of time going crazy over explanations not explaining much and hurting our brains and souls, Rao, a coach with a nice and funny meow-like name gave us some more options and we found out how to do all that. We implemented the merge sorting algorithm and that did not take us much time from here. The funny surprise though was that at the end, we cleared the 3 170k words files in around 1.5 seconds each&hellip; While every other algorithm just took at least 10 minutes. Some even calculated that theirs could last for a day just sorting one of the files. Algorithms are crazy and are to be known!</p>

<p>Now, time to go back and code guys, see ya!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I won&rsquo;t go as far as to tell everything since the last post. Challenges went by, I continued pairing with Armando, working at my strange company that just ended up closing, and then the closer I got to my 8000 miles travel, the busier I got&hellip;</p>

<p>Plus, I just ended up taking all the time I could get to see my fiance.
And let me tell you guys : That was worth it, and a very good idea !</p>

<p>Then, 3 days ago I arrived in SF. I just had time to discover simple things here and there, get an account at the bank, a mobile line, and all the things you need for a simple life nowadays.</p>

<p>Now, up to the main topic :</p>

<h2>The program started</h2>

<p>So, yesterday, we were expected at Dev Bootcamp, just at the entrance of Chinatown, for 9AM. We met the last remaining people of the cohort that we had not met before, and waited there, anxiously waiting.
At 9AM sharp, shouts and claps started right behind that little door we had not passed yet&hellip;</p>

<p>They opened the doors, and things went wild.
I won&rsquo;t go as far as to explain everything in details, but for this first post in a while I&rsquo;ll just sum it up as :</p>

<ul>
<li>People are awesome. Teachers, Coaches, other students, other cohorts, everybody!</li>
<li>We should be expecting 60-80 hours weeks, and even there we probably won&rsquo;t get over everything anyway.</li>
<li>Sherif, one of our teachers, is really eloquent&hellip; You can hear pure knowledge come out of his mouth&hellip; That&rsquo;s insane</li>
<li>Sherif told us repeatedly : We are insane for thinking it is doable. But the common insanity is what bounds us and may end up making it possible.</li>
<li>We are guinea pigs. The program we will be living will be a bit different than the others, but then I&rsquo;ll explain that later.</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, I can say that we are joining a program that shows us how to work and let us do the job and find about what to do and how, assess our learning,&hellip;
We are basically the ones making it possible. Teachers guide us, but that is all.</p>

<p>Now, time to head up to DBC again, cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, DBC prep is well on (expect a bigger post about that some time soon of course), and this week, we got a challenge about refactoring a couple of classes and some calls to these classes about a Drawer and Silverware we&#8217;ld clean and put in it. And our goal here is to refactor and correct the errors we could find.<br/>
After talking with some boots from the cohort (DBC language, read &ldquo;colleagues&rdquo;), I found that people were getting stuck on the exact same part of this challenge, so I figured some may like having some explanation on what&rsquo;s up here. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&hellip; here is my first step into the blogging world. (&lt;&ndash; I must have rewritten that sentence a thousand times over the years&hellip; I like to think  of it as the thing that prevented me from blogging so far  ) )<br/>
